Book 01	Genesis

001:001 In the beginning God created the heaven and the earth.

001:002 And the earth was without form, and void; and darkness was
        upon the face of the deep. And the Spirit of God moved upon
        the face of the waters.

001:003 And God said, Let there be light: and there was light.

001:004 And God saw the light, that it was good: and God divided the
        light from the darkness.

001:005 And God called the light Day, and the darkness he called
        Night. And the evening and the morning were the first day.

001:006 And God said, Let there be a firmament in the midst of the
        waters, and let it divide the waters from the waters.

001:007 And God made the firmament, and divided the waters which were
        under the firmament from the waters which were above the
        firmament: and it was so.

001:008 And God called the firmament Heaven. And the evening and the
        morning were the second day.

001:009 And God said, Let the waters under the heaven be gathered
        together unto one place, and let the dry land appear: and it
        was so.

001:010 And God called the dry land Earth; and the gathering together
        of the waters called he Seas: and God saw that it was good.

001:011 And God said, Let the earth bring forth grass, the herb
        yielding seed, and the fruit tree yielding fruit after his
        kind, whose seed is in itself, upon the earth: and it was so.

001:012 And the earth brought forth grass, and herb yielding seed
        after his kind, and the tree yielding fruit, whose seed was in
        itself, after his kind: and God saw that it was good.

001:013 And the evening and the morning were the third day.

001:014 And God said, Let there be lights in the firmament of the
        heaven to divide the day from the night; and let them be for
        signs, and for seasons, and for days, and years:

001:015 And let them be for lights in the firmament of the heaven to
        give light upon the earth: and it was so.

001:016 And God made two great lights; the greater light to rule the
        day, and the lesser light to rule the night: he made the stars
        also.

001:017 And God set them in the firmament of the heaven to give light
        upon the earth,

001:018 And to rule over the day and over the night, and to divide the
        light from the darkness: and God saw that it was good.

001:019 And the evening and the morning were the fourth day.

001:020 And God said, Let the waters bring forth abundantly the moving
        creature that hath life, and fowl that may fly above the earth
        in the open firmament of heaven.

001:021 And God created great whales, and every living creature that
        moveth, which the waters brought forth abundantly, after their
        kind, and every winged fowl after his kind: and God saw that
        it was good.

001:022 And God blessed them, saying, Be fruitful, and multiply, and
        fill the waters in the seas, and let fowl multiply in the
        earth.

001:023 And the evening and the morning were the fifth day.

001:024 And God said, Let the earth bring forth the living creature
        after his kind, cattle, and creeping thing, and beast of the
        earth after his kind: and it was so.

001:025 And God made the beast of the earth after his kind, and cattle
        after their kind, and every thing that creepeth upon the earth
        after his kind: and God saw that it was good.

001:026 And God said, Let us make man in our image, after our
        likeness: and let them have dominion over the fish of the sea,
        and over the fowl of the air, and over the cattle, and over
        all the earth, and over every creeping thing that creepeth
        upon the earth.

001:027 So God created man in his own image, in the image of God
        created he him; male and female created he them.

001:028 And God blessed them, and God said unto them, Be fruitful, and
        multiply, and replenish the earth, and subdue it: and have
        dominion over the fish of the sea, and over the fowl of the
        air, and over every living thing that moveth upon the earth.

001:029 And God said, Behold, I have given you every herb bearing
        seed, which is upon the face of all the earth, and every tree,
        in the which is the fruit of a tree yielding seed; to you it
        shall be for meat.

001:030 And to every beast of the earth, and to every fowl of the air,
        and to every thing that creepeth upon the earth, wherein there
        is life, I have given every green herb for meat: and it was
        so.

001:031 And God saw every thing that he had made, and, behold, it was
        very good. And the evening and the morning were the sixth day.

002:001 Thus the heavens and the earth were finished, and all the host
        of them.

002:002 And on the seventh day God ended his work which he had made;
        and he rested on the seventh day from all his work which he
        had made.

002:003 And God blessed the seventh day, and sanctified it: because
        that in it he had rested from all his work which God created
        and made.

002:004 These are the generations of the heavens and of the earth when
        they were created, in the day that the LORD God made the earth
        and the heavens,

002:005 And every plant of the field before it was in the earth, and
        every herb of the field before it grew: for the LORD God had
        not caused it to rain upon the earth, and there was not a man
        to till the ground.

002:006 But there went up a mist from the earth, and watered the whole
        face of the ground.

002:007 And the LORD God formed man of the dust of the ground, and
        breathed into his nostrils the breath of life; and man became
        a living soul.

002:008 And the LORD God planted a garden eastward in Eden; and there
        he put the man whom he had formed.

002:009 And out of the ground made the LORD God to grow every tree
        that is pleasant to the sight, and good for food; the tree of
        life also in the midst of the garden, and the tree of
        knowledge of good and evil.

002:010 And a river went out of Eden to water the garden; and from
        thence it was parted, and became into four heads.

002:011 The name of the first is Pison: that is it which compasseth
        the whole land of Havilah, where there is gold;

002:012 And the gold of that land is good: there is bdellium and the
        onyx stone.

002:013 And the name of the second river is Gihon: the same is it that
        compasseth the whole land of Ethiopia.

002:014 And the name of the third river is Hiddekel: that is it which
        goeth toward the east of Assyria. And the fourth river is
        Euphrates.

002:015 And the LORD God took the man, and put him into the garden of
        Eden to dress it and to keep it.

002:016 And the LORD God commanded the man, saying, Of every tree of
        the garden thou mayest freely eat:

002:017 But of the tree of the knowledge of good and evil, thou shalt
        not eat of it: for in the day that thou eatest thereof thou
        shalt surely die.

002:018 And the LORD God said, It is not good that the man should be
        alone; I will make him an help meet for him.

002:019 And out of the ground the LORD God formed every beast of the
        field, and every fowl of the air; and brought them unto Adam
        to see what he would call them: and whatsoever Adam called
        every living creature, that was the name thereof.

002:020 And Adam gave names to all cattle, and to the fowl of the air,
        and to every beast of the field; but for Adam there was not
        found an help meet for him.

002:021 And the LORD God caused a deep sleep to fall upon Adam, and he
        slept: and he took one of his ribs, and closed up the flesh
        instead thereof;

002:022 And the rib, which the LORD God had taken from man, made he a
        woman, and brought her unto the man.

002:023 And Adam said, This is now bone of my bones, and flesh of my
        flesh: she shall be called Woman, because she was taken out of
        Man.

002:024 Therefore shall a man leave his father and his mother, and
        shall cleave unto his wife: and they shall be one flesh.

002:025 And they were both naked, the man and his wife, and were not
        ashamed.

003:001 Now the serpent was more subtil than any beast of the field
        which the LORD God had made. And he said unto the woman, Yea,
        hath God said, Ye shall not eat of every tree of the garden?

003:002 And the woman said unto the serpent, We may eat of the fruit
        of the trees of the garden:

003:003 But of the fruit of the tree which is in the midst of the
        garden, God hath said, Ye shall not eat of it, neither shall
        ye touch it, lest ye die.

003:004 And the serpent said unto the woman, Ye shall not surely die:

003:005 For God doth know that in the day ye eat thereof, then your
        eyes shall be opened, and ye shall be as gods, knowing good
        and evil.

003:006 And when the woman saw that the tree was good for food, and
        that it was pleasant to the eyes, and a tree to be desired to
        make one wise, she took of the fruit thereof, and did eat, and
        gave also unto her husband with her; and he did eat.

003:007 And the eyes of them both were opened, and they knew that they
        were naked; and they sewed fig leaves together, and made
        themselves aprons.

003:008 And they heard the voice of the LORD God walking in the garden
        in the cool of the day: and Adam and his wife hid themselves
        from the presence of the LORD God amongst the trees of the
        garden.

003:009 And the LORD God called unto Adam, and said unto him, Where
        art thou?

003:010 And he said, I heard thy voice in the garden, and I was
        afraid, because I was naked; and I hid myself.

003:011 And he said, Who told thee that thou wast naked? Hast thou
        eaten of the tree, whereof I commanded thee that thou
        shouldest not eat?

003:012 And the man said, The woman whom thou gavest to be with me,
        she gave me of the tree, and I did eat.

003:013 And the LORD God said unto the woman, What is this that thou
        hast done? And the woman said, The serpent beguiled me, and I
        did eat.

003:014 And the LORD God said unto the serpent, Because thou hast done
        this, thou art cursed above all cattle, and above every beast
        of the field; upon thy belly shalt thou go, and dust shalt
        thou eat all the days of thy life:

003:015 And I will put enmity between thee and the woman, and between
        thy seed and her seed; it shall bruise thy head, and thou
        shalt bruise his heel.

003:016 Unto the woman he said, I will greatly multiply thy sorrow and
        thy conception; in sorrow thou shalt bring forth children; and
        thy desire shall be to thy husband, and he shall rule over
        thee.

003:017 And unto Adam he said, Because thou hast hearkened unto the
        voice of thy wife, and hast eaten of the tree, of which I
        commanded thee, saying, Thou shalt not eat of it: cursed is
        the ground for thy sake; in sorrow shalt thou eat of it all
        the days of thy life;

003:018 Thorns also and thistles shall it bring forth to thee; and
        thou shalt eat the herb of the field;

003:019 In the sweat of thy face shalt thou eat bread, till thou
        return unto the ground; for out of it wast thou taken: for
        dust thou art, and unto dust shalt thou return.

003:020 And Adam called his wife's name Eve; because she was the
        mother of all living.

003:021 Unto Adam also and to his wife did the LORD God make coats of
        skins, and clothed them.

003:022 And the LORD God said, Behold, the man is become as one of us,
        to know good and evil: and now, lest he put forth his hand,
        and take also of the tree of life, and eat, and live for ever:

003:023 Therefore the LORD God sent him forth from the garden of Eden,
        to till the ground from whence he was taken.

003:024 So he drove out the man; and he placed at the east of the
        garden of Eden Cherubims, and a flaming sword which turned
        every way, to keep the way of the tree of life.

004:001 And Adam knew Eve his wife; and she conceived, and bare Cain,
        and said, I have gotten a man from the LORD.

004:002 And she again bare his brother Abel. And Abel was a keeper of
        sheep, but Cain was a tiller of the ground.

004:003 And in process of time it came to pass, that Cain brought of
        the fruit of the ground an offering unto the LORD.

004:004 And Abel, he also brought of the firstlings of his flock and
        of the fat thereof. And the LORD had respect unto Abel and to
        his offering:

004:005 But unto Cain and to his offering he had not respect. And Cain
        was very wroth, and his countenance fell.

004:006 And the LORD said unto Cain, Why art thou wroth? and why is
        thy countenance fallen?

004:007 If thou doest well, shalt thou not be accepted? and if thou
        doest not well, sin lieth at the door. And unto thee shall be
        his desire, and thou shalt rule over him.

004:008 And Cain talked with Abel his brother: and it came to pass,
        when they were in the field, that Cain rose up against Abel
        his brother, and slew him.

004:009 And the LORD said unto Cain, Where is Abel thy brother? And he
        said, I know not: Am I my brother's keeper?

004:010 And he said, What hast thou done? the voice of thy brother's
        blood crieth unto me from the ground.

004:011 And now art thou cursed from the earth, which hath opened her
        mouth to receive thy brother's blood from thy hand;

004:012 When thou tillest the ground, it shall not henceforth yield
        unto thee her strength; a fugitive and a vagabond shalt thou
        be in the earth.

004:013 And Cain said unto the LORD, My punishment is greater than I
        can bear.

004:014 Behold, thou hast driven me out this day from the face of the
        earth; and from thy face shall I be hid; and I shall be a
        fugitive and a vagabond in the earth; and it shall come to
        pass, that every one that findeth me shall slay me.

004:015 And the LORD said unto him, Therefore whosoever slayeth Cain,
        vengeance shall be taken on him sevenfold. And the LORD set a
        mark upon Cain, lest any finding him should kill him.

004:016 And Cain went out from the presence of the LORD, and dwelt in
        the land of Nod, on the east of Eden.

004:017 And Cain knew his wife; and she conceived, and bare Enoch: and
        he builded a city, and called the name of the city, after the
        name of his son, Enoch.

004:018 And unto Enoch was born Irad: and Irad begat Mehujael: and
        Mehujael begat Methusael: and Methusael begat Lamech.

004:019 And Lamech took unto him two wives: the name of the one was
        Adah, and the name of the other Zillah.

004:020 And Adah bare Jabal: he was the father of such as dwell in
        tents, and of such as have cattle.

004:021 And his brother's name was Jubal: he was the father of all
        such as handle the harp and organ.

004:022 And Zillah, she also bare Tubalcain, an instructer of every
        artificer in brass and iron: and the sister of Tubalcain was
        Naamah.

004:023 And Lamech said unto his wives, Adah and Zillah, Hear my
        voice; ye wives of Lamech, hearken unto my speech: for I have
        slain a man to my wounding, and a young man to my hurt.

004:024 If Cain shall be avenged sevenfold, truly Lamech seventy and
        sevenfold.

004:025 And Adam knew his wife again; and she bare a son, and called
        his name Seth: For God, said she, hath appointed me another
        seed instead of Abel, whom Cain slew.

004:026 And to Seth, to him also there was born a son; and he called
        his name Enos: then began men to call upon the name of the
        LORD.

005:001 This is the book of the generations of Adam. In the day that
        God created man, in the likeness of God made he him;

005:002 Male and female created he them; and blessed them, and called
        their name Adam, in the day when they were created.

005:003 And Adam lived an hundred and thirty years, and begat a son in
        his own likeness, and after his image; and called his name
        Seth:

005:004 And the days of Adam after he had begotten Seth were eight
        hundred years: and he begat sons and daughters:

005:005 And all the days that Adam lived were nine hundred and thirty
        years: and he died.

005:006 And Seth lived an hundred and five years, and begat Enos:

005:007 And Seth lived after he begat Enos eight hundred and seven
        years, and begat sons and daughters:

005:008 And all the days of Seth were nine hundred and twelve years:
        and he died.

005:009 And Enos lived ninety years, and begat Cainan:

005:010 And Enos lived after he begat Cainan eight hundred and fifteen
        years, and begat sons and daughters:

005:011 And all the days of Enos were nine hundred and five years: and
        he died.

005:012 And Cainan lived seventy years and begat Mahalaleel:

005:013 And Cainan lived after he begat Mahalaleel eight hundred and
        forty years, and begat sons and daughters:

005:014 And all the days of Cainan were nine hundred and ten years:
        and he died.

005:015 And Mahalaleel lived sixty and five years, and begat Jared:

005:016 And Mahalaleel lived after he begat Jared eight hundred and
        thirty years, and begat sons and daughters:

005:017 And all the days of Mahalaleel were eight hundred ninety and
        five years: and he died.

005:018 And Jared lived an hundred sixty and two years, and he begat
        Enoch:

005:019 And Jared lived after he begat Enoch eight hundred years, and
        begat sons and daughters:

005:020 And all the days of Jared were nine hundred sixty and two
        years: and he died.

005:021 And Enoch lived sixty and five years, and begat Methuselah:

005:022 And Enoch walked with God after he begat Methuselah three
        hundred years, and begat sons and daughters:

005:023 And all the days of Enoch were three hundred sixty and five
        years:

005:024 And Enoch walked with God: and he was not; for God took him.

005:025 And Methuselah lived an hundred eighty and seven years, and
        begat Lamech.

005:026 And Methuselah lived after he begat Lamech seven hundred
        eighty and two years, and begat sons and daughters:

005:027 And all the days of Methuselah were nine hundred sixty and
        nine years: and he died.

005:028 And Lamech lived an hundred eighty and two years, and begat a
        son:

005:029 And he called his name Noah, saying, This same shall comfort
        us concerning our work and toil of our hands, because of the
        ground which the LORD hath cursed.

005:030 And Lamech lived after he begat Noah five hundred ninety and
        five years, and begat sons and daughters:

005:031 And all the days of Lamech were seven hundred seventy and
        seven years: and he died.

005:032 And Noah was five hundred years old: and Noah begat Shem, Ham,
        and Japheth.

006:001 And it came to pass, when men began to multiply on the face of
        the earth, and daughters were born unto them,

006:002 That the sons of God saw the daughters of men that they were
        fair; and they took them wives of all which they chose.

006:003 And the LORD said, My spirit shall not always strive with man,
        for that he also is flesh: yet his days shall be an hundred
        and twenty years.

006:004 There were giants in the earth in those days; and also after
        that, when the sons of God came in unto the daughters of men,
        and they bare children to them, the same became mighty men
        which were of old, men of renown.

006:005 And God saw that the wickedness of man was great in the earth,
        and that every imagination of the thoughts of his heart was
        only evil continually.

006:006 And it repented the LORD that he had made man on the earth,
        and it grieved him at his heart.

006:007 And the LORD said, I will destroy man whom I have created from
        the face of the earth; both man, and beast, and the creeping
        thing, and the fowls of the air; for it repenteth me that I
        have made them.

006:008 But Noah found grace in the eyes of the LORD.

006:009 These are the generations of Noah: Noah was a just man and
        perfect in his generations, and Noah walked with God.

006:010 And Noah begat three sons, Shem, Ham, and Japheth.

006:011 The earth also was corrupt before God, and the earth was
        filled with violence.

006:012 And God looked upon the earth, and, behold, it was corrupt;
        for all flesh had corrupted his way upon the earth.

006:013 And God said unto Noah, The end of all flesh is come before
        me; for the earth is filled with violence through them; and,
        behold, I will destroy them with the earth.

006:014 Make thee an ark of gopher wood; rooms shalt thou make in the
        ark, and shalt pitch it within and without with pitch.

006:015 And this is the fashion which thou shalt make it of: The
        length of the ark shall be three hundred cubits, the breadth
        of it fifty cubits, and the height of it thirty cubits.

006:016 A window shalt thou make to the ark, and in a cubit shalt thou
        finish it above; and the door of the ark shalt thou set in the
        side thereof; with lower, second, and third stories shalt thou
        make it.

006:017 And, behold, I, even I, do bring a flood of waters upon the
        earth, to destroy all flesh, wherein is the breath of life,
        from under heaven; and every thing that is in the earth shall
        die.

006:018 But with thee will I establish my covenant; and thou shalt
        come into the ark, thou, and thy sons, and thy wife, and thy
        sons' wives with thee.

006:019 And of every living thing of all flesh, two of every sort
        shalt thou bring into the ark, to keep them alive with thee;
        they shall be male and female.

006:020 Of fowls after their kind, and of cattle after their kind, of
        every creeping thing of the earth after his kind, two of every
        sort shall come unto thee, to keep them alive.

006:021 And take thou unto thee of all food that is eaten, and thou
        shalt gather it to thee; and it shall be for food for thee,
        and for them.

006:022 Thus did Noah; according to all that God commanded him, so did
        he.

007:001 And the LORD said unto Noah, Come thou and all thy house into
        the ark; for thee have I seen righteous before me in this
        generation.

007:002 Of every clean beast thou shalt take to thee by sevens, the
        male and his female: and of beasts that are not clean by two,
        the male and his female.

007:003 Of fowls also of the air by sevens, the male and the female;
        to keep seed alive upon the face of all the earth.

007:004 For yet seven days, and I will cause it to rain upon the earth
        forty days and forty nights; and every living substance that I
        have made will I destroy from off the face of the earth.

007:005 And Noah did according unto all that the LORD commanded him.

007:006 And Noah was six hundred years old when the flood of waters
        was upon the earth.

007:007 And Noah went in, and his sons, and his wife, and his sons'
        wives with him, into the ark, because of the waters of the
        flood.

007:008 Of clean beasts, and of beasts that are not clean, and of
        fowls, and of every thing that creepeth upon the earth,

007:009 There went in two and two unto Noah into the ark, the male and
        the female, as God had commanded Noah.

007:010 And it came to pass after seven days, that the waters of the
        flood were upon the earth.

007:011 In the six hundredth year of Noah's life, in the second month,
        the seventeenth day of the month, the same day were all the
        fountains of the great deep broken up, and the windows of
        heaven were opened.

007:012 And the rain was upon the earth forty days and forty nights.

007:013 In the selfsame day entered Noah, and Shem, and Ham, and
        Japheth, the sons of Noah, and Noah's wife, and the three
        wives of his sons with them, into the ark;

007:014 They, and every beast after his kind, and all the cattle after
        their kind, and every creeping thing that creepeth upon the
        earth after his kind, and every fowl after his kind, every
        bird of every sort.

007:015 And they went in unto Noah into the ark, two and two of all
        flesh, wherein is the breath of life.

007:016 And they that went in, went in male and female of all flesh,
        as God had commanded him: and the LORD shut him in.

007:017 And the flood was forty days upon the earth; and the waters
        increased, and bare up the ark, and it was lift up above the
        earth.

007:018 And the waters prevailed, and were increased greatly upon the
        earth; and the ark went upon the face of the waters.

007:019 And the waters prevailed exceedingly upon the earth; and all
        the high hills, that were under the whole heaven, were
        covered.

007:020 Fifteen cubits upward did the waters prevail; and the
        mountains were covered.

007:021 And all flesh died that moved upon the earth, both of fowl,
        and of cattle, and of beast, and of every creeping thing that
        creepeth upon the earth, and every man:

007:022 All in whose nostrils was the breath of life, of all that was
        in the dry land, died.

007:023 And every living substance was destroyed which was upon the
        face of the ground, both man, and cattle, and the creeping
        things, and the fowl of the heaven; and they were destroyed
        from the earth: and Noah only remained alive, and they that
        were with him in the ark.

007:024 And the waters prevailed upon the earth an hundred and fifty
        days.

008:001 And God remembered Noah, and every living thing, and all the
        cattle that was with him in the ark: and God made a wind to
        pass over the earth, and the waters asswaged;

008:002 The fountains also of the deep and the windows of heaven were
        stopped, and the rain from heaven was restrained;

008:003 And the waters returned from off the earth continually: and
        after the end of the hundred and fifty days the waters were
        abated.

008:004 And the ark rested in the seventh month, on the seventeenth
        day of the month, upon the mountains of Ararat.

008:005 And the waters decreased continually until the tenth month: in
        the tenth month, on the first day of the month, were the tops
        of the mountains seen.

008:006 And it came to pass at the end of forty days, that Noah opened
        the window of the ark which he had made:

008:007 And he sent forth a raven, which went forth to and fro, until
        the waters were dried up from off the earth.

008:008 Also he sent forth a dove from him, to see if the waters were
        abated from off the face of the ground;

008:009 But the dove found no rest for the sole of her foot, and she
        returned unto him into the ark, for the waters were on the
        face of the whole earth: then he put forth his hand, and took
        her, and pulled her in unto him into the ark.

008:010 And he stayed yet other seven days; and again he sent forth
        the dove out of the ark;

008:011 And the dove came in to him in the evening; and, lo, in her
        mouth was an olive leaf pluckt off: so Noah knew that the
        waters were abated from off the earth.

008:012 And he stayed yet other seven days; and sent forth the dove;
        which returned not again unto him any more.

008:013 And it came to pass in the six hundredth and first year, in
        the first month, the first day of the month, the waters were
        dried up from off the earth: and Noah removed the covering of
        the ark, and looked, and, behold, the face of the ground was
        dry.

008:014 And in the second month, on the seven and twentieth day of the
        month, was the earth dried.

008:015 And God spake unto Noah, saying,

008:016 Go forth of the ark, thou, and thy wife, and thy sons, and thy
        sons' wives with thee.

008:017 Bring forth with thee every living thing that is with thee, of
        all flesh, both of fowl, and of cattle, and of every creeping
        thing that creepeth upon the earth; that they may breed
        abundantly in the earth, and be fruitful, and multiply upon
        the earth.

008:018 And Noah went forth, and his sons, and his wife, and his sons'
        wives with him:

008:019 Every beast, every creeping thing, and every fowl, and
        whatsoever creepeth upon the earth, after their kinds, went
        forth out of the ark.

008:020 And Noah builded an altar unto the LORD; and took of every
        clean beast, and of every clean fowl, and offered burnt
        offerings on the altar.

008:021 And the LORD smelled a sweet savour; and the LORD said in his
        heart, I will not again curse the ground any more for man's
        sake; for the imagination of man's heart is evil from his
        youth; neither will I again smite any more every thing living,
        as I have done.

008:022 While the earth remaineth, seedtime and harvest, and cold and
        heat, and summer and winter, and day and night shall not
        cease.

009:001 And God blessed Noah and his sons, and said unto them, Be
        fruitful, and multiply, and replenish the earth.

009:002 And the fear of you and the dread of you shall be upon every
        beast of the earth, and upon every fowl of the air, upon all
        that moveth upon the earth, and upon all the fishes of the
        sea; into your hand are they delivered.

009:003 Every moving thing that liveth shall be meat for you; even as
        the green herb have I given you all things.

009:004 But flesh with the life thereof, which is the blood thereof,
        shall ye not eat.

009:005 And surely your blood of your lives will I require; at the
        hand of every beast will I require it, and at the hand of man;
        at the hand of every man's brother will I require the life of
        man.

009:006 Whoso sheddeth man's blood, by man shall his blood be shed:
        for in the image of God made he man.

009:007 And you, be ye fruitful, and multiply; bring forth abundantly
        in the earth, and multiply therein.

009:008 And God spake unto Noah, and to his sons with him, saying,

009:009 And I, behold, I establish my covenant with you, and with your
        seed after you;

009:010 And with every living creature that is with you, of the fowl,
        of the cattle, and of every beast of the earth with you; from
        all that go out of the ark, to every beast of the earth.

009:011 And I will establish my covenant with you, neither shall all
        flesh be cut off any more by the waters of a flood; neither
        shall there any more be a flood to destroy the earth.

009:012 And God said, This is the token of the covenant which I make
        between me and you and every living creature that is with you,
        for perpetual generations:

009:013 I do set my bow in the cloud, and it shall be for a token of a
        covenant between me and the earth.

009:014 And it shall come to pass, when I bring a cloud over the
        earth, that the bow shall be seen in the cloud:

009:015 And I will remember my covenant, which is between me and you
        and every living creature of all flesh; and the waters shall
        no more become a flood to destroy all flesh.

009:016 And the bow shall be in the cloud; and I will look upon it,
        that I may remember the everlasting covenant between God and
        every living creature of all flesh that is upon the earth.

009:017 And God said unto Noah, This is the token of the covenant,
        which I have established between me and all flesh that is upon
        the earth.

009:018 And the sons of Noah, that went forth of the ark, were Shem,
        and Ham, and Japheth: and Ham is the father of Canaan.

009:019 These are the three sons of Noah: and of them was the whole
        earth overspread.

009:020 And Noah began to be an husbandman, and he planted a vineyard:

009:021 And he drank of the wine, and was drunken; and he was
        uncovered within his tent.

009:022 And Ham, the father of Canaan, saw the nakedness of his
        father, and told his two brethren without.

009:023 And Shem and Japheth took a garment, and laid it upon both
        their shoulders, and went backward, and covered the nakedness
        of their father; and their faces were backward, and they saw
        not their father's nakedness.

009:024 And Noah awoke from his wine, and knew what his younger son
        had done unto him.

009:025 And he said, Cursed be Canaan; a servant of servants shall he
        be unto his brethren.

009:026 And he said, Blessed be the LORD God of Shem; and Canaan shall
        be his servant.

009:027 God shall enlarge Japheth, and he shall dwell in the tents of
        Shem; and Canaan shall be his servant.

009:028 And Noah lived after the flood three hundred and fifty years.

009:029 And all the days of Noah were nine hundred and fifty years:
        and he died.

010:001 Now these are the generations of the sons of Noah, Shem, Ham,
        and Japheth: and unto them were sons born after the flood.

010:002 The sons of Japheth; Gomer, and Magog, and Madai, and Javan,
        and Tubal, and Meshech, and Tiras.

010:003 And the sons of Gomer; Ashkenaz, and Riphath, and Togarmah.

010:004 And the sons of Javan; Elishah, and Tarshish, Kittim, and
        Dodanim.

010:005 By these were the isles of the Gentiles divided in their
        lands; every one after his tongue, after their families, in
        their nations.

010:006 And the sons of Ham; Cush, and Mizraim, and Phut, and Canaan.

010:007 And the sons of Cush; Seba, and Havilah, and Sabtah, and
        Raamah, and Sabtechah: and the sons of Raamah; Sheba, and
        Dedan.

010:008 And Cush begat Nimrod: he began to be a mighty one in the
        earth.

010:009 He was a mighty hunter before the LORD: wherefore it is said,
        Even as Nimrod the mighty hunter before the LORD.

010:010 And the beginning of his kingdom was Babel, and Erech, and
        Accad, and Calneh, in the land of Shinar.

010:011 Out of that land went forth Asshur, and builded Nineveh, and
        the city Rehoboth, and Calah,

010:012 And Resen between Nineveh and Calah: the same is a great city.

010:013 And Mizraim begat Ludim, and Anamim, and Lehabim, and
        Naphtuhim,

010:014 And Pathrusim, and Casluhim, (out of whom came Philistim,) and
        Caphtorim.

010:015 And Canaan begat Sidon his first born, and Heth,

010:016 And the Jebusite, and the Amorite, and the Girgasite,

010:017 And the Hivite, and the Arkite, and the Sinite,

010:018 And the Arvadite, and the Zemarite, and the Hamathite: and
        afterward were the families of the Canaanites spread abroad.

010:019 And the border of the Canaanites was from Sidon, as thou
        comest to Gerar, unto Gaza; as thou goest, unto Sodom, and
        Gomorrah, and Admah, and Zeboim, even unto Lasha.

010:020 These are the sons of Ham, after their families, after their
        tongues, in their countries, and in their nations.

010:021 Unto Shem also, the father of all the children of Eber, the
        brother of Japheth the elder, even to him were children born.

010:022 The children of Shem; Elam, and Asshur, and Arphaxad, and Lud,
        and Aram.

010:023 And the children of Aram; Uz, and Hul, and Gether, and Mash.

010:024 And Arphaxad begat Salah; and Salah begat Eber.

010:025 And unto Eber were born two sons: the name of one was Peleg;
        for in his days was the earth divided; and his brother's name
        was Joktan.

010:026 And Joktan begat Almodad, and Sheleph, and Hazarmaveth, and
        Jerah,

010:027 And Hadoram, and Uzal, and Diklah,

010:028 And Obal, and Abimael, and Sheba,

010:029 And Ophir, and Havilah, and Jobab: all these were the sons of
        Joktan.

010:030 And their dwelling was from Mesha, as thou goest unto Sephar a
        mount of the east.

010:031 These are the sons of Shem, after their families, after their
        tongues, in their lands, after their nations.

010:032 These are the families of the sons of Noah, after their
        generations, in their nations: and by these were the nations
        divided in the earth after the flood.

011:001 And the whole earth was of one language, and of one speech.

011:002 And it came to pass, as they journeyed from the east, that
        they found a plain in the land of Shinar; and they dwelt
        there.

011:003 And they said one to another, Go to, let us make brick, and
        burn them thoroughly. And they had brick for stone, and slime
        had they for morter.

011:004 And they said, Go to, let us build us a city and a tower,
        whose top may reach unto heaven; and let us make us a name,
        lest we be scattered abroad upon the face of the whole earth.

011:005 And the LORD came down to see the city and the tower, which
        the children of men builded.

011:006 And the LORD said, Behold, the people is one, and they have
        all one language; and this they begin to do: and now nothing
        will be restrained from them, which they have imagined to do.

011:007 Go to, let us go down, and there confound their language, that
        they may not understand one another's speech.

011:008 So the LORD scattered them abroad from thence upon the face of
        all the earth: and they left off to build the city.

011:009 Therefore is the name of it called Babel; because the LORD did
        there confound the language of all the earth: and from thence
        did the LORD scatter them abroad upon the face of all the
        earth.

011:010 These are the generations of Shem: Shem was an hundred years
        old, and begat Arphaxad two years after the flood:

011:011 And Shem lived after he begat Arphaxad five hundred years, and
        begat sons and daughters.

011:012 And Arphaxad lived five and thirty years, and begat Salah:

011:013 And Arphaxad lived after he begat Salah four hundred and three
        years, and begat sons and daughters.

011:014 And Salah lived thirty years, and begat Eber:

011:015 And Salah lived after he begat Eber four hundred and three
        years, and begat sons and daughters.

011:016 And Eber lived four and thirty years, and begat Peleg:

011:017 And Eber lived after he begat Peleg four hundred and thirty
        years, and begat sons and daughters.

011:018 And Peleg lived thirty years, and begat Reu:

011:019 And Peleg lived after he begat Reu two hundred and nine years,
        and begat sons and daughters.

011:020 And Reu lived two and thirty years, and begat Serug:

011:021 And Reu lived after he begat Serug two hundred and seven
        years, and begat sons and daughters.

011:022 And Serug lived thirty years, and begat Nahor:

011:023 And Serug lived after he begat Nahor two hundred years, and
        begat sons and daughters.

011:024 And Nahor lived nine and twenty years, and begat Terah:

011:025 And Nahor lived after he begat Terah an hundred and nineteen
        years, and begat sons and daughters.

011:026 And Terah lived seventy years, and begat Abram, Nahor, and
        Haran.

011:027 Now these are the generations of Terah: Terah begat Abram,
        Nahor, and Haran; and Haran begat Lot.

011:028 And Haran died before his father Terah in the land of his
        nativity, in Ur of the Chaldees.

011:029 And Abram and Nahor took them wives: the name of Abram's wife
        was Sarai; and the name of Nahor's wife, Milcah, the daughter
        of Haran, the father of Milcah, and the father of Iscah.

011:030 But Sarai was barren; she had no child.

011:031 And Terah took Abram his son, and Lot the son of Haran his
        son's son, and Sarai his daughter in law, his son Abram's
        wife; and they went forth with them from Ur of the Chaldees,
        to go into the land of Canaan; and they came unto Haran, and
        dwelt there.

011:032 And the days of Terah were two hundred and five years: and
        Terah died in Haran.

012:001 Now the LORD had said unto Abram, Get thee out of thy country,
        and from thy kindred, and from thy father's house, unto a land
        that I will shew thee:

012:002 And I will make of thee a great nation, and I will bless thee,
        and make thy name great; and thou shalt be a blessing:

012:003 And I will bless them that bless thee, and curse him that
        curseth thee: and in thee shall all families of the earth be
        blessed.

012:004 So Abram departed, as the LORD had spoken unto him; and Lot
        went with him: and Abram was seventy and five years old when
        he departed out of Haran.

012:005 And Abram took Sarai his wife, and Lot his brother's son, and
        all their substance that they had gathered, and the souls that
        they had gotten in Haran; and they went forth to go into the
        land of Canaan; and into the land of Canaan they came.

012:006 And Abram passed through the land unto the place of Sichem,
        unto the plain of Moreh. And the Canaanite was then in the
        land.

012:007 And the LORD appeared unto Abram, and said, Unto thy seed will
        I give this land: and there builded he an altar unto the LORD,
        who appeared unto him.

012:008 And he removed from thence unto a mountain on the east of
        Bethel, and pitched his tent, having Bethel on the west, and
        Hai on the east: and there he builded an altar unto the LORD,
        and called upon the name of the LORD.

012:009 And Abram journeyed, going on still toward the south.

012:010 And there was a famine in the land: and Abram went down into
        Egypt to sojourn there; for the famine was grievous in the
        land.

012:011 And it came to pass, when he was come near to enter into
        Egypt, that he said unto Sarai his wife, Behold now, I know
        that thou art a fair woman to look upon:

012:012 Therefore it shall come to pass, when the Egyptians shall see
        thee, that they shall say, This is his wife: and they will
        kill me, but they will save thee alive.

012:013 Say, I pray thee, thou art my sister: that it may be well with
        me for thy sake; and my soul shall live because of thee.

012:014 And it came to pass, that, when Abram was come into Egypt, the
        Egyptians beheld the woman that she was very fair.

012:015 The princes also of Pharaoh saw her, and commended her before
        Pharaoh: and the woman was taken into Pharaoh's house.

012:016 And he entreated Abram well for her sake: and he had sheep,
        and oxen, and he asses, and menservants, and maidservants, and
        she asses, and camels.

012:017 And the LORD plagued Pharaoh and his house with great plagues
        because of Sarai Abram's wife.

012:018 And Pharaoh called Abram and said, What is this that thou hast
        done unto me? why didst thou not tell me that she was thy
        wife?

012:019 Why saidst thou, She is my sister? so I might have taken her
        to me to wife: now therefore behold thy wife, take her, and go
        thy way.

012:020 And Pharaoh commanded his men concerning him: and they sent
        him away, and his wife, and all that he had.

013:001 And Abram went up out of Egypt, he, and his wife, and all that
        he had, and Lot with him, into the south.

013:002 And Abram was very rich in cattle, in silver, and in gold.

013:003 And he went on his journeys from the south even to Bethel,
        unto the place where his tent had been at the beginning,
        between Bethel and Hai;

013:004 Unto the place of the altar, which he had make there at the
        first: and there Abram called on the name of the LORD.

013:005 And Lot also, which went with Abram, had flocks, and herds,
        and tents.

013:006 And the land was not able to bear them, that they might dwell
        together: for their substance was great, so that they could
        not dwell together.

013:007 And there was a strife between the herdmen of Abram's cattle
        and the herdmen of Lot's cattle: and the Canaanite and the
        Perizzite dwelled then in the land.

013:008 And Abram said unto Lot, Let there be no strife, I pray thee,
        between me and thee, and between my herdmen and thy herdmen;
        for we be brethren.

013:009 Is not the whole land before thee? separate thyself, I pray
        thee, from me: if thou wilt take the left hand, then I will go
        to the right; or if thou depart to the right hand, then I will
        go to the left.

013:010 And Lot lifted up his eyes, and beheld all the plain of
        Jordan, that it was well watered every where, before the LORD
        destroyed Sodom and Gomorrah, even as the garden of the LORD,
        like the land of Egypt, as thou comest unto Zoar.

013:011 Then Lot chose him all the plain of Jordan; and Lot journeyed
        east: and they separated themselves the one from the other.

013:012 Abram dwelled in the land of Canaan, and Lot dwelled in the
        cities of the plain, and pitched his tent toward Sodom.

013:013 But the men of Sodom were wicked and sinners before the LORD
        exceedingly.

013:014 And the LORD said unto Abram, after that Lot was separated
        from him, Lift up now thine eyes, and look from the place
        where thou art northward, and southward, and eastward, and
        westward:

013:015 For all the land which thou seest, to thee will I give it, and
        to thy seed for ever.

013:016 And I will make thy seed as the dust of the earth: so that if
        a man can number the dust of the earth, then shall thy seed
        also be numbered.

013:017 Arise, walk through the land in the length of it and in the
        breadth of it; for I will give it unto thee.

013:018 Then Abram removed his tent, and came and dwelt in the plain
        of Mamre, which is in Hebron, and built there an altar unto
        the LORD.

014:001 And it came to pass in the days of Amraphel king of Shinar,
        Arioch king of Ellasar, Chedorlaomer king of Elam, and Tidal
        king of nations;

014:002 That these made war with Bera king of Sodom, and with Birsha
        king of Gomorrah, Shinab king of Admah, and Shemeber king of
        Zeboiim, and the king of Bela, which is Zoar.

014:003 All these were joined together in the vale of Siddim, which is
        the salt sea.

014:004 Twelve years they served Chedorlaomer, and in the thirteenth
        year they rebelled.

014:005 And in the fourteenth year came Chedorlaomer, and the kings
        that were with him, and smote the Rephaims in Ashteroth
        Karnaim, and the Zuzims in Ham, and the Emins in Shaveh
        Kiriathaim,

014:006 And the Horites in their mount Seir, unto Elparan, which is by
        the wilderness.

014:007 And they returned, and came to Enmishpat, which is Kadesh, and
        smote all the country of the Amalekites, and also the
        Amorites, that dwelt in Hazezontamar.

014:008 And there went out the king of Sodom, and the king of
        Gomorrah, and the king of Admah, and the king of Zeboiim, and
        the king of Bela (the same is Zoar;) and they joined battle
        with them in the vale of Siddim;

014:009 With Chedorlaomer the king of Elam, and with Tidal king of
        nations, and Amraphel king of Shinar, and Arioch king of
        Ellasar; four kings with five.

014:010 And the vale of Siddim was full of slimepits; and the kings of
        Sodom and Gomorrah fled, and fell there; and they that
        remained fled to the mountain.

014:011 And they took all the goods of Sodom and Gomorrah, and all
        their victuals, and went their way.

014:012 And they took Lot, Abram's brother's son, who dwelt in Sodom,
        and his goods, and departed.

014:013 And there came one that had escaped, and told Abram the
        Hebrew; for he dwelt in the plain of Mamre the Amorite,
        brother of Eshcol, and brother of Aner: and these were
        confederate with Abram.

014:014 And when Abram heard that his brother was taken captive, he
        armed his trained servants, born in his own house, three
        hundred and eighteen, and pursued them unto Dan.

014:015 And he divided himself against them, he and his servants, by
        night, and smote them, and pursued them unto Hobah, which is
        on the left hand of Damascus.

014:016 And he brought back all the goods, and also brought again his
        brother Lot, and his goods, and the women also, and the
        people.

014:017 And the king of Sodom went out to meet him after his return
        from the slaughter of Chedorlaomer, and of the kings that were
        with him, at the valley of Shaveh, which is the king's dale.

014:018 And Melchizedek king of Salem brought forth bread and wine:
        and he was the priest of the most high God.

014:019 And he blessed him, and said, Blessed be Abram of the most
        high God, possessor of heaven and earth:

014:020 And blessed be the most high God, which hath delivered thine
        enemies into thy hand. And he gave him tithes of all.

014:021 And the king of Sodom said unto Abram, Give me the persons,
        and take the goods to thyself.

014:022 And Abram said to the king of Sodom, I have lift up mine hand
        unto the LORD, the most high God, the possessor of heaven and
        earth,

014:023 That I will not take from a thread even to a shoelatchet, and
        that I will not take any thing that is thine, lest thou
        shouldest say, I have made Abram rich:

014:024 Save only that which the young men have eaten, and the portion
        of the men which went with me, Aner, Eshcol, and Mamre; let
        them take their portion.

015:001 After these things the word of the LORD came unto Abram in a
        vision, saying, Fear not, Abram: I am thy shield, and thy
        exceeding great reward.

015:002 And Abram said, LORD God, what wilt thou give me, seeing I go
        childless, and the steward of my house is this Eliezer of
        Damascus?

015:003 And Abram said, Behold, to me thou hast given no seed: and,
        lo, one born in my house is mine heir.

015:004 And, behold, the word of the LORD came unto him, saying, This
        shall not be thine heir; but he that shall come forth out of
        thine own bowels shall be thine heir.

015:005 And he brought him forth abroad, and said, Look now toward
        heaven, and tell the stars, if thou be able to number them:
        and he said unto him, So shall thy seed be.

015:006 And he believed in the LORD; and he counted it to him for
        righteousness.

015:007 And he said unto him, I am the LORD that brought thee out of
        Ur of the Chaldees, to give thee this land to inherit it.

015:008 And he said, LORD God, whereby shall I know that I shall
        inherit it?

015:009 And he said unto him, Take me an heifer of three years old,
        and a she goat of three years old, and a ram of three years
        old, and a turtledove, and a young pigeon.

015:010 And he took unto him all these, and divided them in the midst,
        and laid each piece one against another: but the birds divided
        he not.

015:011 And when the fowls came down upon the carcases, Abram drove
        them away.

015:012 And when the sun was going down, a deep sleep fell upon Abram;
        and, lo, an horror of great darkness fell upon him.

015:013 And he said unto Abram, Know of a surety that thy seed shall
        be a stranger in a land that is not their's, and shall serve
        them; and they shall afflict them four hundred years;

015:014 And also that nation, whom they shall serve, will I judge: and
        afterward shall they come out with great substance.

015:015 And thou shalt go to thy fathers in peace; thou shalt be
        buried in a good old age.

015:016 But in the fourth generation they shall come hither again: for
        the iniquity of the Amorites is not yet full.

015:017 And it came to pass, that, when the sun went down, and it was
        dark, behold a smoking furnace, and a burning lamp that passed
        between those pieces.

015:018 In the same day the LORD made a covenant with Abram, saying,
        Unto thy seed have I given this land, from the river of Egypt
        unto the great river, the river Euphrates:

015:019 The Kenites, and the Kenizzites, and the Kadmonites,

015:020 And the Hittites, and the Perizzites, and the Rephaims,

015:021 And the Amorites, and the Canaanites, and the Girgashites, and
        the Jebusites.

016:001 Now Sarai Abram's wife bare him no children: and she had an
        handmaid, an Egyptian, whose name was Hagar.

016:002 And Sarai said unto Abram, Behold now, the LORD hath
        restrained me from bearing: I pray thee, go in unto my maid;
        it may be that I may obtain children by her. And Abram
        hearkened to the voice of Sarai.

016:003 And Sarai Abram's wife took Hagar her maid the Egyptian, after
        Abram had dwelt ten years in the land of Canaan, and gave her
        to her husband Abram to be his wife.

016:004 And he went in unto Hagar, and she conceived: and when she saw
        that she had conceived, her mistress was despised in her eyes.

016:005 And Sarai said unto Abram, My wrong be upon thee: I have given
        my maid into thy bosom; and when she saw that she had
        conceived, I was despised in her eyes: the LORD judge between
        me and thee.

016:006 But Abram said unto Sarai, Behold, thy maid is in thine hand;
        do to her as it pleaseth thee. And when Sarai dealt hardly
        with her, she fled from her face.

016:007 And the angel of the LORD found her by a fountain of water in
        the wilderness, by the fountain in the way to Shur.

016:008 And he said, Hagar, Sarai's maid, whence camest thou? and
        whither wilt thou go? And she said, I flee from the face of my
        mistress Sarai.

016:009 And the angel of the LORD said unto her, Return to thy
        mistress, and submit thyself under her hands.

016:010 And the angel of the LORD said unto her, I will multiply thy
        seed exceedingly, that it shall not be numbered for multitude.

016:011 And the angel of the LORD said unto her, Behold, thou art with
        child and shalt bear a son, and shalt call his name Ishmael;
        because the LORD hath heard thy affliction.

016:012 And he will be a wild man; his hand will be against every man,
        and every man's hand against him; and he shall dwell in the
        presence of all his brethren.

016:013 And she called the name of the LORD that spake unto her, Thou
        God seest me: for she said, Have I also here looked after him
        that seeth me?

016:014 Wherefore the well was called Beerlahairoi; behold, it is
        between Kadesh and Bered.

016:015 And Hagar bare Abram a son: and Abram called his son's name,
        which Hagar bare, Ishmael.

016:016 And Abram was fourscore and six years old, when Hagar bare
        Ishmael to Abram.

017:001 And when Abram was ninety years old and nine, the LORD
        appeared to Abram, and said unto him, I am the Almighty God;
        walk before me, and be thou perfect.

017:002 And I will make my covenant between me and thee, and will
        multiply thee exceedingly.

017:003 And Abram fell on his face: and God talked with him, saying,

017:004 As for me, behold, my covenant is with thee, and thou shalt be
        a father of many nations.

017:005 Neither shall thy name any more be called Abram, but thy name
        shall be Abraham; for a father of many nations have I made
        thee.

017:006 And I will make thee exceeding fruitful, and I will make
        nations of thee, and kings shall come out of thee.

017:007 And I will establish my covenant between me and thee and thy
        seed after thee in their generations for an everlasting
        covenant, to be a God unto thee, and to thy seed after thee.

017:008 And I will give unto thee, and to thy seed after thee, the
        land wherein thou art a stranger, all the land of Canaan, for
        an everlasting possession; and I will be their God.

017:009 And God said unto Abraham, Thou shalt keep my covenant
        therefore, thou, and thy seed after thee in their generations.

017:010 This is my covenant, which ye shall keep, between me and you
        and thy seed after thee; Every man child among you shall be
        circumcised.

017:011 And ye shall circumcise the flesh of your foreskin; and it
        shall be a token of the covenant betwixt me and you.

017:012 And he that is eight days old shall be circumcised among you,
        every man child in your generations, he that is born in the
        house, or bought with money of any stranger, which is not of
        thy seed.

017:013 He that is born in thy house, and he that is bought with thy
        money, must needs be circumcised: and my covenant shall be in
        your flesh for an everlasting covenant.

017:014 And the uncircumcised man child whose flesh of his foreskin is
        not circumcised, that soul shall be cut off from his people;
        he hath broken my covenant.

017:015 And God said unto Abraham, As for Sarai thy wife, thou shalt
        not call her name Sarai, but Sarah shall her name be.

017:016 And I will bless her, and give thee a son also of her: yea, I
        will bless her, and she shall be a mother of nations; kings of
        people shall be of her.

017:017 Then Abraham fell upon his face, and laughed, and said in his
        heart, Shall a child be born unto him that is an hundred years
        old? and shall Sarah, that is ninety years old, bear?

017:018 And Abraham said unto God, O that Ishmael might live before
        thee!

017:019 And God said, Sarah thy wife shall bear thee a son indeed; and
        thou shalt call his name Isaac: and I will establish my
        covenant with him for an everlasting covenant, and with his
        seed after him.

017:020 And as for Ishmael, I have heard thee: Behold, I have blessed
        him, and will make him fruitful, and will multiply him
        exceedingly; twelve princes shall he beget, and I will make
        him a great nation.

017:021 But my covenant will I establish with Isaac, which Sarah shall
        bear unto thee at this set time in the next year.

017:022 And he left off talking with him, and God went up from
        Abraham.

017:023 And Abraham took Ishmael his son, and all that were born in
        his house, and all that were bought with his money, every male
        among the men of Abraham's house; and circumcised the flesh of
        their foreskin in the selfsame day, as God had said unto him.

017:024 And Abraham was ninety years old and nine, when he was
        circumcised in the flesh of his foreskin.

017:025 And Ishmael his son was thirteen years old, when he was
        circumcised in the flesh of his foreskin.

017:026 In the selfsame day was Abraham circumcised, and Ishmael his
        son.

017:027 And all the men of his house, born in the house, and bought
        with money of the stranger, were circumcised with him.

018:001 And the LORD appeared unto him in the plains of Mamre: and he
        sat in the tent door in the heat of the day;

018:002 And he lift up his eyes and looked, and, lo, three men stood
        by him: and when he saw them, he ran to meet them from the
        tent door, and bowed himself toward the ground,

018:003 And said, My LORD, if now I have found favour in thy sight,
        pass not away, I pray thee, from thy servant:

018:004 Let a little water, I pray you, be fetched, and wash your
        feet, and rest yourselves under the tree:

018:005 And I will fetch a morsel of bread, and comfort ye your
        hearts; after that ye shall pass on: for therefore are ye come
        to your servant. And they said, So do, as thou hast said.

018:006 And Abraham hastened into the tent unto Sarah, and said, Make
        ready quickly three measures of fine meal, knead it, and make
        cakes upon the hearth.

018:007 And Abraham ran unto the herd, and fetcht a calf tender and
        good, and gave it unto a young man; and he hasted to dress it.

018:008 And he took butter, and milk, and the calf which he had
        dressed, and set it before them; and he stood by them under
        the tree, and they did eat.

018:009 And they said unto him, Where is Sarah thy wife? And he said,
        Behold, in the tent.

018:010 And he said, I will certainly return unto thee according to
        the time of life; and, lo, Sarah thy wife shall have a son.
        And Sarah heard it in the tent door, which was behind him.

018:011 Now Abraham and Sarah were old and well stricken in age; and
        it ceased to be with Sarah after the manner of women.

018:012 Therefore Sarah laughed within herself, saying, After I am
        waxed old shall I have pleasure, my lord being old also?

018:013 And the LORD said unto Abraham, Wherefore did Sarah laugh,
        saying, Shall I of a surety bear a child, which am old?

018:014 Is any thing too hard for the LORD? At the time appointed I
        will return unto thee, according to the time of life, and
        Sarah shall have a son.

018:015 Then Sarah denied, saying, I laughed not; for she was afraid.
        And he said, Nay; but thou didst laugh.

018:016 And the men rose up from thence, and looked toward Sodom: and
        Abraham went with them to bring them on the way.

018:017 And the LORD said, Shall I hide from Abraham that thing which
        I do;

018:018 Seeing that Abraham shall surely become a great and mighty
        nation, and all the nations of the earth shall be blessed in
        him?

018:019 For I know him, that he will command his children and his
        household after him, and they shall keep the way of the LORD,
        to do justice and judgment; that the LORD may bring upon
        Abraham that which he hath spoken of him.

018:020 And the LORD said, Because the cry of Sodom and Gomorrah is
        great, and because their sin is very grievous;

018:021 I will go down now, and see whether they have done altogether
        according to the cry of it, which is come unto me; and if not,
        I will know.

018:022 And the men turned their faces from thence, and went toward
        Sodom: but Abraham stood yet before the LORD.

018:023 And Abraham drew near, and said, Wilt thou also destroy the
        righteous with the wicked?

018:024 Peradventure there be fifty righteous within the city: wilt
        thou also destroy and not spare the place for the fifty
        righteous that are therein?

018:025 That be far from thee to do after this manner, to slay the
        righteous with the wicked: and that the righteous should be as
        the wicked, that be far from thee: Shall not the Judge of all
        the earth do right?

018:026 And the LORD said, If I find in Sodom fifty righteous within
        the city, then I will spare all the place for their sakes.

018:027 And Abraham answered and said, Behold now, I have taken upon
        me to speak unto the LORD, which am but dust and ashes:

018:028 Peradventure there shall lack five of the fifty righteous:
        wilt thou destroy all the city for lack of five? And he said,
        If I find there forty and five, I will not destroy it.

018:029 And he spake unto him yet again, and said, Peradventure there
        shall be forty found there. And he said, I will not do it for
        forty's sake.

018:030 And he said unto him, Oh let not the LORD be angry, and I will
        speak: Peradventure there shall thirty be found there. And he
        said, I will not do it, if I find thirty there.

018:031 And he said, Behold now, I have taken upon me to speak unto
        the LORD: Peradventure there shall be twenty found there. And
        he said, I will not destroy it for twenty's sake.

018:032 And he said, Oh let not the LORD be angry, and I will speak
        yet but this once: Peradventure ten shall be found there. And
        he said, I will not destroy it for ten's sake.

018:033 And the LORD went his way, as soon as he had left communing
        with Abraham: and Abraham returned unto his place.

019:001 And there came two angels to Sodom at even; and Lot sat in the
        gate of Sodom: and Lot seeing them rose up to meet them; and
        he bowed himself with his face toward the ground;

019:002 And he said, Behold now, my lords, turn in, I pray you, into
        your servant's house, and tarry all night, and wash your feet,
        and ye shall rise up early, and go on your ways. And they
        said, Nay; but we will abide in the street all night.

019:003 And he pressed upon them greatly; and they turned in unto him,
        and entered into his house; and he made them a feast, and did
        bake unleavened bread, and they did eat.

019:004 But before they lay down, the men of the city, even the men of
        Sodom, compassed the house round, both old and young, all the
        people from every quarter:

019:005 And they called unto Lot, and said unto him, Where are the men
        which came in to thee this night? bring them out unto us, that
        we may know them.

019:006 And Lot went out at the door unto them, and shut the door
        after him,

019:007 And said, I pray you, brethren, do not so wickedly.

019:008 Behold now, I have two daughters which have not known man; let
        me, I pray you, bring them out unto you, and do ye to them as
        is good in your eyes: only unto these men do nothing; for
        therefore came they under the shadow of my roof.

019:009 And they said, Stand back. And they said again, This one
        fellow came in to sojourn, and he will needs be a judge: now
        will we deal worse with thee, than with them. And they pressed
        sore upon the man, even Lot, and came near to break the door.

019:010 But the men put forth their hand, and pulled Lot into the
        house to them, and shut to the door.

019:011 And they smote the men that were at the door of the house with
        blindness, both small and great: so that they wearied
        themselves to find the door.

019:012 And the men said unto Lot, Hast thou here any besides? son in
        law, and thy sons, and thy daughters, and whatsoever thou hast
        in the city, bring them out of this place:

019:013 For we will destroy this place, because the cry of them is
        waxen great before the face of the LORD; and the LORD hath
        sent us to destroy it.

019:014 And Lot went out, and spake unto his sons in law, which
        married his daughters, and said, Up, get you out of this
        place; for the LORD will destroy this city. But he seemed as
        one that mocked unto his sons in law.

019:015 And when the morning arose, then the angels hastened Lot,
        saying, Arise, take thy wife, and thy two daughters, which are
        here; lest thou be consumed in the iniquity of the city.

019:016 And while he lingered, the men laid hold upon his hand, and
        upon the hand of his wife, and upon the hand of his two
        daughters; the LORD being merciful unto him: and they brought
        him forth, and set him without the city.

019:017 And it came to pass, when they had brought them forth abroad,
        that he said, Escape for thy life; look not behind thee,
        neither stay thou in all the plain; escape to the mountain,
        lest thou be consumed.

019:018 And Lot said unto them, Oh, not so, my LORD:

019:019 Behold now, thy servant hath found grace in thy sight, and
        thou hast magnified thy mercy, which thou hast shewed unto me
        in saving my life; and I cannot escape to the mountain, lest
        some evil take me, and I die:

019:020 Behold now, this city is near to flee unto, and it is a little
        one: Oh, let me escape thither, (is it not a little one?) and
        my soul shall live.

019:021 And he said unto him, See, I have accepted thee concerning
        this thing also, that I will not overthrow this city, for the
        which thou hast spoken.

019:022 Haste thee, escape thither; for I cannot do anything till thou
        be come thither. Therefore the name of the city was called
        Zoar.

019:023 The sun was risen upon the earth when Lot entered into Zoar.

019:024 Then the LORD rained upon Sodom and upon Gomorrah brimstone
        and fire from the LORD out of heaven;

019:025 And he overthrew those cities, and all the plain, and all the
        inhabitants of the cities, and that which grew upon the
        ground.

019:026 But his wife looked back from behind him, and she became a
        pillar of salt.

019:027 And Abraham gat up early in the morning to the place where he
        stood before the LORD:

019:028 And he looked toward Sodom and Gomorrah, and toward all the
        land of the plain, and beheld, and, lo, the smoke of the
        country went up as the smoke of a furnace.

019:029 And it came to pass, when God destroyed the cities of the
        plain, that God remembered Abraham, and sent Lot out of the
        midst of the overthrow, when he overthrew the cities in the
        which Lot dwelt.

019:030 And Lot went up out of Zoar, and dwelt in the mountain, and
        his two daughters with him; for he feared to dwell in Zoar:
        and he dwelt in a cave, he and his two daughters.

019:031 And the firstborn said unto the younger, Our father is old,
        and there is not a man in the earth to come in unto us after
        the manner of all the earth:

019:032 Come, let us make our father drink wine, and we will lie with
        him, that we may preserve seed of our father.

019:033 And they made their father drink wine that night: and the
        firstborn went in, and lay with her father; and he perceived
        not when she lay down, nor when she arose.

019:034 And it came to pass on the morrow, that the firstborn said
        unto the younger, Behold, I lay yesternight with my father:
        let us make him drink wine this night also; and go thou in,
        and lie with him, that we may preserve seed of our father.

019:035 And they made their father drink wine that night also: and the
        younger arose, and lay with him; and he perceived not when she
        lay down, nor when she arose.

019:036 Thus were both the daughters of Lot with child by their
        father.

019:037 And the first born bare a son, and called his name Moab: the
        same is the father of the Moabites unto this day.

019:038 And the younger, she also bare a son, and called his name
        Benammi: the same is the father of the children of Ammon unto
        this day.

020:001 And Abraham journeyed from thence toward the south country,
        and dwelled between Kadesh and Shur, and sojourned in Gerar.

020:002 And Abraham said of Sarah his wife, She is my sister: and
        Abimelech king of Gerar sent, and took Sarah.

020:003 But God came to Abimelech in a dream by night, and said to
        him, Behold, thou art but a dead man, for the woman which thou
        hast taken; for she is a man's wife.

020:004 But Abimelech had not come near her: and he said, LORD, wilt
        thou slay also a righteous nation?

020:005 Said he not unto me, She is my sister? and she, even she
        herself said, He is my brother: in the integrity of my heart
        and innocency of my hands have I done this.

020:006 And God said unto him in a dream, Yea, I know that thou didst
        this in the integrity of thy heart; for I also withheld thee
        from sinning against me: therefore suffered I thee not to
        touch her.

020:007 Now therefore restore the man his wife; for he is a prophet,
        and he shall pray for thee, and thou shalt live: and if thou
        restore her not, know thou that thou shalt surely die, thou,
        and all that are thine.

020:008 Therefore Abimelech rose early in the morning, and called all
        his servants, and told all these things in their ears: and the
        men were sore afraid.

020:009 Then Abimelech called Abraham, and said unto him, What hast
        thou done unto us? and what have I offended thee, that thou
        hast brought on me and on my kingdom a great sin? thou hast
        done deeds unto me that ought not to be done.

020:010 And Abimelech said unto Abraham, What sawest thou, that thou
        hast done this thing?

020:011 And Abraham said, Because I thought, Surely the fear of God is
        not in this place; and they will slay me for my wife's sake.

020:012 And yet indeed she is my sister; she is the daughter of my
        father, but not the daughter of my mother; and she became my
        wife.

020:013 And it came to pass, when God caused me to wander from my
        father's house, that I said unto her, This is thy kindness
        which thou shalt shew unto me; at every place whither we shall
        come, say of me, He is my brother.

020:014 And Abimelech took sheep, and oxen, and menservants, and
        womenservants, and gave them unto Abraham, and restored him
        Sarah his wife.

020:015 And Abimelech said, Behold, my land is before thee: dwell
        where it pleaseth thee.

020:016 And unto Sarah he said, Behold, I have given thy brother a
        thousand pieces of silver: behold, he is to thee a covering of
        the eyes, unto all that are with thee, and with all other:
        thus she was reproved.

020:017 So Abraham prayed unto God: and God healed Abimelech, and his
        wife, and his maidservants; and they bare children.

020:018 For the LORD had fast closed up all the wombs of the house of
        Abimelech, because of Sarah Abraham's wife.

021:001 And the LORD visited Sarah as he had said, and the LORD did
        unto Sarah as he had spoken.

021:002 For Sarah conceived, and bare Abraham a son in his old age, at
        the set time of which God had spoken to him.

021:003 And Abraham called the name of his son that was born unto him,
        whom Sarah bare to him, Isaac.

021:004 And Abraham circumcised his son Isaac being eight days old, as
        God had commanded him.

021:005 And Abraham was an hundred years old, when his son Isaac was
        born unto him.

021:006 And Sarah said, God hath made me to laugh, so that all that
        hear will laugh with me.

021:007 And she said, Who would have said unto Abraham, that Sarah
        should have given children suck? for I have born him a son in
        his old age.

021:008 And the child grew, and was weaned: and Abraham made a great
        feast the same day that Isaac was weaned.

021:009 And Sarah saw the son of Hagar the Egyptian, which she had
        born unto Abraham, mocking.

021:010 Wherefore she said unto Abraham, Cast out this bondwoman and
        her son: for the son of this bondwoman shall not be heir with
        my son, even with Isaac.

021:011 And the thing was very grievous in Abraham's sight because of
        his son.

021:012 And God said unto Abraham, Let it not be grievous in thy sight
        because of the lad, and because of thy bondwoman; in all that
        Sarah hath said unto thee, hearken unto her voice; for in
        Isaac shall thy seed be called.

021:013 And also of the son of the bondwoman will I make a nation,
        because he is thy seed.

021:014 And Abraham rose up early in the morning, and took bread, and
        a bottle of water, and gave it unto Hagar, putting it on her
        shoulder, and the child, and sent her away: and she departed,
        and wandered in the wilderness of Beersheba.

021:015 And the water was spent in the bottle, and she cast the child
        under one of the shrubs.

021:016 And she went, and sat her down over against him a good way
        off, as it were a bow shot: for she said, Let me not see the
        death of the child. And she sat over against him, and lift up
        her voice, and wept.

021:017 And God heard the voice of the lad; and the angel of God
        called to Hagar out of heaven, and said unto her, What aileth
        thee, Hagar? fear not; for God hath heard the voice of the lad
        where he is.

021:018 Arise, lift up the lad, and hold him in thine hand; for I will
        make him a great nation.

021:019 And God opened her eyes, and she saw a well of water; and she
        went, and filled the bottle with water, and gave the lad
        drink.

021:020 And God was with the lad; and he grew, and dwelt in the
        wilderness, and became an archer.

021:021 And he dwelt in the wilderness of Paran: and his mother took
        him a wife out of the land of Egypt.

021:022 And it came to pass at that time, that Abimelech and Phichol
        the chief captain of his host spake unto Abraham, saying, God
        is with thee in all that thou doest:

021:023 Now therefore swear unto me here by God that thou wilt not
        deal falsely with me, nor with my son, nor with my son's son:
        but according to the kindness that I have done unto thee, thou
        shalt do unto me, and to the land wherein thou hast sojourned.

021:024 And Abraham said, I will swear.

021:025 And Abraham reproved Abimelech because of a well of water,
        which Abimelech's servants had violently taken away.

021:026 And Abimelech said, I wot not who hath done this thing;
        neither didst thou tell me, neither yet heard I of it, but to
        day.

021:027 And Abraham took sheep and oxen, and gave them unto Abimelech;
        and both of them made a covenant.

021:028 And Abraham set seven ewe lambs of the flock by themselves.

021:029 And Abimelech said unto Abraham, What mean these seven ewe
        lambs which thou hast set by themselves?

021:030 And he said, For these seven ewe lambs shalt thou take of my
        hand, that they may be a witness unto me, that I have digged
        this well.

021:031 Wherefore he called that place Beersheba; because there they
        sware both of them.

021:032 Thus they made a covenant at Beersheba: then Abimelech rose
        up, and Phichol the chief captain of his host, and they
        returned into the land of the Philistines.

021:033 And Abraham planted a grove in Beersheba, and called there on
        the name of the LORD, the everlasting God.

021:034 And Abraham sojourned in the Philistines' land many days.

022:001 And it came to pass after these things, that God did tempt
        Abraham, and said unto him, Abraham: and he said, Behold, here
        I am.

022:002 And he said, Take now thy son, thine only son Isaac, whom thou
        lovest, and get thee into the land of Moriah; and offer him
        there for a burnt offering upon one of the mountains which I
        will tell thee of.

022:003 And Abraham rose up early in the morning, and saddled his ass,
        and took two of his young men with him, and Isaac his son, and
        clave the wood for the burnt offering, and rose up, and went
        unto the place of which God had told him.

022:004 Then on the third day Abraham lifted up his eyes, and saw the
        place afar off.

022:005 And Abraham said unto his young men, Abide ye here with the
        ass; and I and the lad will go yonder and worship, and come
        again to you.

022:006 And Abraham took the wood of the burnt offering, and laid it
        upon Isaac his son; and he took the fire in his hand, and a
        knife; and they went both of them together.

022:007 And Isaac spake unto Abraham his father, and said, My father:
        and he said, Here am I, my son. And he said, Behold the fire
        and the wood: but where is the lamb for a burnt offering?

022:008 And Abraham said, My son, God will provide himself a lamb for
        a burnt offering: so they went both of them together.

022:009 And they came to the place which God had told him of; and
        Abraham built an altar there, and laid the wood in order, and
        bound Isaac his son, and laid him on the altar upon the wood.

022:010 And Abraham stretched forth his hand, and took the knife to
        slay his son.

022:011 And the angel of the LORD called unto him out of heaven, and
        said, Abraham, Abraham: and he said, Here am I.

022:012 And he said, Lay not thine hand upon the lad, neither do thou
        any thing unto him: for now I know that thou fearest God,
        seeing thou hast not withheld thy son, thine only son from me.

022:013 And Abraham lifted up his eyes, and looked, and behold behind
        him a ram caught in a thicket by his horns: and Abraham went
        and took the ram, and offered him up for a burnt offering in
        the stead of his son.

022:014 And Abraham called the name of that place Jehovahjireh: as it
        is said to this day, In the mount of the LORD it shall be
        seen.

022:015 And the angel of the LORD called unto Abraham out of heaven
        the second time,

022:016 And said, By myself have I sworn, saith the LORD, for because
        thou hast done this thing, and hast not withheld thy son,
        thine only son:

022:017 That in blessing I will bless thee, and in multiplying I will
        multiply thy seed as the stars of the heaven, and as the sand
        which is upon the sea shore; and thy seed shall possess the
        gate of his enemies;

022:018 And in thy seed shall all the nations of the earth be blessed;
        because thou hast obeyed my voice.

022:019 So Abraham returned unto his young men, and they rose up and
        went together to Beersheba; and Abraham dwelt at Beersheba.

022:020 And it came to pass after these things, that it was told
        Abraham, saying, Behold, Milcah, she hath also born children
        unto thy brother Nahor;

022:021 Huz his firstborn, and Buz his brother, and Kemuel the father
        of Aram,

022:022 And Chesed, and Hazo, and Pildash, and Jidlaph, and Bethuel.

022:023 And Bethuel begat Rebekah: these eight Milcah did bear to
        Nahor, Abraham's brother.

022:024 And his concubine, whose name was Reumah, she bare also Tebah,
        and Gaham, and Thahash, and Maachah.

023:001 And Sarah was an hundred and seven and twenty years old: these
        were the years of the life of Sarah.

023:002 And Sarah died in Kirjatharba; the same is Hebron in the land
        of Canaan: and Abraham came to mourn for Sarah, and to weep
        for her.

023:003 And Abraham stood up from before his dead, and spake unto the
        sons of Heth, saying,

023:004 I am a stranger and a sojourner with you: give me a possession
        of a buryingplace with you, that I may bury my dead out of my
        sight.

023:005 And the children of Heth answered Abraham, saying unto him,

023:006 Hear us, my lord: thou art a mighty prince among us: in the
        choice of our sepulchres bury thy dead; none of us shall
        withhold from thee his sepulchre, but that thou mayest bury
        thy dead.

023:007 And Abraham stood up, and bowed himself to the people of the
        land, even to the children of Heth.

023:008 And he communed with them, saying, If it be your mind that I
        should bury my dead out of my sight; hear me, and intreat for
        me to Ephron the son of Zohar,

023:009 That he may give me the cave of Machpelah, which he hath,
        which is in the end of his field; for as much money as it is
        worth he shall give it me for a possession of a buryingplace
        amongst you.

023:010 And Ephron dwelt among the children of Heth: and Ephron the
        Hittite answered Abraham in the audience of the children of
        Heth, even of all that went in at the gate of his city,
        saying,

023:011 Nay, my lord, hear me: the field give I thee, and the cave
        that is therein, I give it thee; in the presence of the sons
        of my people give I it thee: bury thy dead.

023:012 And Abraham bowed down himself before the people of the land.

023:013 And he spake unto Ephron in the audience of the people of the
        land, saying, But if thou wilt give it, I pray thee, hear me:
        I will give thee money for the field; take it of me, and I
        will bury my dead there.

023:014 And Ephron answered Abraham, saying unto him,

023:015 My lord, hearken unto me: the land is worth four hundred
        shekels of silver; what is that betwixt me and thee? bury
        therefore thy dead.

023:016 And Abraham hearkened unto Ephron; and Abraham weighed to
        Ephron the silver, which he had named in the audience of the
        sons of Heth, four hundred shekels of silver, current money
        with the merchant.

023:017 And the field of Ephron which was in Machpelah, which was
        before Mamre, the field, and the cave which was therein, and
        all the trees that were in the field, that were in all the
        borders round about, were made sure

023:018 Unto Abraham for a possession in the presence of the children
        of Heth, before all that went in at the gate of his city.

023:019 And after this, Abraham buried Sarah his wife in the cave of
        the field of Machpelah before Mamre: the same is Hebron in the
        land of Canaan.

023:020 And the field, and the cave that is therein, were made sure
        unto Abraham for a possession of a buryingplace by the sons of
        Heth.

024:001 And Abraham was old, and well stricken in age: and the LORD
        had blessed Abraham in all things.

024:002 And Abraham said unto his eldest servant of his house, that
        ruled over all that he had, Put, I pray thee, thy hand under
        my thigh:

024:003 And I will make thee swear by the LORD, the God of heaven, and
        the God of the earth, that thou shalt not take a wife unto my
        son of the daughters of the Canaanites, among whom I dwell:

024:004 But thou shalt go unto my country, and to my kindred, and take
        a wife unto my son Isaac.

024:005 And the servant said unto him, Peradventure the woman will not
        be willing to follow me unto this land: must I needs bring thy
        son again unto the land from whence thou camest?

024:006 And Abraham said unto him, Beware thou that thou bring not my
        son thither again.

024:007 The LORD God of heaven, which took me from my father's house,
        and from the land of my kindred, and which spake unto me, and
        that sware unto me, saying, Unto thy seed will I give this
        land; he shall send his angel before thee, and thou shalt take
        a wife unto my son from thence.

024:008 And if the woman will not be willing to follow thee, then thou
        shalt be clear from this my oath: only bring not my son
        thither again.

024:009 And the servant put his hand under the thigh of Abraham his
        master, and sware to him concerning that matter.

024:010 And the servant took ten camels of the camels of his master,
        and departed; for all the goods of his master were in his
        hand: and he arose, and went to Mesopotamia, unto the city of
        Nahor.

024:011 And he made his camels to kneel down without the city by a
        well of water at the time of the evening, even the time that
        women go out to draw water.

024:012 And he said O LORD God of my master Abraham, I pray thee, send
        me good speed this day, and shew kindness unto my master
        Abraham.

024:013 Behold, I stand here by the well of water; and the daughters
        of the men of the city come out to draw water:

024:014 And let it come to pass, that the damsel to whom I shall say,
        Let down thy pitcher, I pray thee, that I may drink; and she
        shall say, Drink, and I will give thy camels drink also: let
        the same be she that thou hast appointed for thy servant
        Isaac; and thereby shall I know that thou hast shewed kindness
        unto my master.

024:015 And it came to pass, before he had done speaking, that,
        behold, Rebekah came out, who was born to Bethuel, son of
        Milcah, the wife of Nahor, Abraham's brother, with her pitcher
        upon her shoulder.

024:016 And the damsel was very fair to look upon, a virgin, neither
        had any man known her: and she went down to the well, and
        filled her pitcher, and came up.

024:017 And the servant ran to meet her, and said, Let me, I pray
        thee, drink a little water of thy pitcher.

024:018 And she said, Drink, my lord: and she hasted, and let down her
        pitcher upon her hand, and gave him drink.

024:019 And when she had done giving him drink, she said, I will draw
        water for thy camels also, until they have done drinking.

024:020 And she hasted, and emptied her pitcher into the trough, and
        ran again unto the well to draw water, and drew for all his
        camels.

024:021 And the man wondering at her held his peace, to wit whether
        the LORD had made his journey prosperous or not.

024:022 And it came to pass, as the camels had done drinking, that the
        man took a golden earring of half a shekel weight, and two
        bracelets for her hands of ten shekels weight of gold;

024:023 And said, Whose daughter art thou? tell me, I pray thee: is
        there room in thy father's house for us to lodge in?

024:024 And she said unto him, I am the daughter of Bethuel the son of
        Milcah, which she bare unto Nahor.

024:025 She said moreover unto him, We have both straw and provender
        enough, and room to lodge in.

024:026 And the man bowed down his head, and worshipped the LORD.

024:027 And he said, Blessed be the LORD God of my master Abraham, who
        hath not left destitute my master of his mercy and his truth:
        I being in the way, the LORD led me to the house of my
        master's brethren.

024:028 And the damsel ran, and told them of her mother's house these
        things.

024:029 And Rebekah had a brother, and his name was Laban: and Laban
        ran out unto the man, unto the well.

024:030 And it came to pass, when he saw the earring and bracelets
        upon his sister's hands, and when he heard the words of
        Rebekah his sister, saying, Thus spake the man unto me; that
        he came unto the man; and, behold, he stood by the camels at
        the well.

024:031 And he said, Come in, thou blessed of the LORD; wherefore
        standest thou without? for I have prepared the house, and room
        for the camels.

024:032 And the man came into the house: and he ungirded his camels,
        and gave straw and provender for the camels, and water to wash
        his feet, and the men's feet that were with him.

024:033 And there was set meat before him to eat: but he said, I will
        not eat, until I have told mine errand. And he said, Speak on.

024:034 And he said, I am Abraham's servant.

024:035 And the LORD hath blessed my master greatly; and he is become
        great: and he hath given him flocks, and herds, and silver,
        and gold, and menservants, and maidservants, and camels, and
        asses.

024:036 And Sarah my master's wife bare a son to my master when she
        was old: and unto him hath he given all that he hath.

024:037 And my master made me swear, saying, Thou shalt not take a
        wife to my son of the daughters of the Canaanites, in whose
        land I dwell:

024:038 But thou shalt go unto my father's house, and to my kindred,
        and take a wife unto my son.

024:039 And I said unto my master, Peradventure the woman will not
        follow me.

024:040 And he said unto me, The LORD, before whom I walk, will send
        his angel with thee, and prosper thy way; and thou shalt take
        a wife for my son of my kindred, and of my father's house:

024:041 Then shalt thou be clear from this my oath, when thou comest
        to my kindred; and if they give not thee one, thou shalt be
        clear from my oath.

024:042 And I came this day unto the well, and said, O LORD God of my
        master Abraham, if now thou do prosper my way which I go:

024:043 Behold, I stand by the well of water; and it shall come to
        pass, that when the virgin cometh forth to draw water, and I
        say to her, Give me, I pray thee, a little water of thy
        pitcher to drink;

024:044 And she say to me, Both drink thou, and I will also draw for
        thy camels: let the same be the woman whom the LORD hath
        appointed out for my master's son.

024:045 And before I had done speaking in mine heart, behold, Rebekah
        came forth with her pitcher on her shoulder; and she went down
        unto the well, and drew water: and I said unto her, Let me
        drink, I pray thee.

024:046 And she made haste, and let down her pitcher from her
        shoulder, and said, Drink, and I will give thy camels drink
        also: so I drank, and she made the camels drink also.

024:047 And I asked her, and said, Whose daughter art thou? And she
        said, the daughter of Bethuel, Nahor's son, whom Milcah bare
        unto him: and I put the earring upon her face, and the
        bracelets upon her hands.

024:048 And I bowed down my head, and worshipped the LORD, and blessed
        the LORD God of my master Abraham, which had led me in the
        right way to take my master's brother's daughter unto his son.

024:049 And now if ye will deal kindly and truly with my master, tell
        me: and if not, tell me; that I may turn to the right hand, or
        to the left.

024:050 Then Laban and Bethuel answered and said, The thing proceedeth
        from the LORD: we cannot speak unto thee bad or good.

024:051 Behold, Rebekah is before thee, take her, and go, and let her
        be thy master's son's wife, as the LORD hath spoken.

024:052 And it came to pass, that, when Abraham's servant heard their
        words, he worshipped the LORD, bowing himself to the earth.

024:053 And the servant brought forth jewels of silver, and jewels of
        gold, and raiment, and gave them to Rebekah: he gave also to
        her brother and to her mother precious things.

024:054 And they did eat and drink, he and the men that were with him,
        and tarried all night; and they rose up in the morning, and he
        said, Send me away unto my master.

024:055 And her brother and her mother said, Let the damsel abide with
        us a few days, at the least ten; after that she shall go.

024:056 And he said unto them, Hinder me not, seeing the LORD hath
        prospered my way; send me away that I may go to my master.

024:057 And they said, We will call the damsel, and enquire at her
        mouth.

024:058 And they called Rebekah, and said unto her, Wilt thou go with
        this man? And she said, I will go.

024:059 And they sent away Rebekah their sister, and her nurse, and
        Abraham's servant, and his men.

024:060 And they blessed Rebekah, and said unto her, Thou art our
        sister, be thou the mother of thousands of millions, and let
        thy seed possess the gate of those which hate them.

024:061 And Rebekah arose, and her damsels, and they rode upon the
        camels, and followed the man: and the servant took Rebekah,
        and went his way.

024:062 And Isaac came from the way of the well Lahairoi; for he dwelt
        in the south country.

024:063 And Isaac went out to meditate in the field at the eventide:
        and he lifted up his eyes, and saw, and, behold, the camels
        were coming.

024:064 And Rebekah lifted up her eyes, and when she saw Isaac, she
        lighted off the camel.

024:065 For she had said unto the servant, What man is this that
        walketh in the field to meet us? And the servant had said, It
        is my master: therefore she took a vail, and covered herself.

024:066 And the servant told Isaac all things that he had done.

024:067 And Isaac brought her into his mother Sarah's tent, and took
        Rebekah, and she became his wife; and he loved her: and Isaac
        was comforted after his mother's death.

025:001 Then again Abraham took a wife, and her name was Keturah.

025:002 And she bare him Zimran, and Jokshan, and Medan, and Midian,
        and Ishbak, and Shuah.

025:003 And Jokshan begat Sheba, and Dedan. And the sons of Dedan were
        Asshurim, and Letushim, and Leummim.

025:004 And the sons of Midian; Ephah, and Epher, and Hanoch, and
        Abidah, and Eldaah. All these were the children of Keturah.

025:005 And Abraham gave all that he had unto Isaac.

025:006 But unto the sons of the concubines, which Abraham had,
        Abraham gave gifts, and sent them away from Isaac his son,
        while he yet lived, eastward, unto the east country.

025:007 And these are the days of the years of Abraham's life which he
        lived, an hundred threescore and fifteen years.

025:008 Then Abraham gave up the ghost, and died in a good old age, an
        old man, and full of years; and was gathered to his people.

025:009 And his sons Isaac and Ishmael buried him in the cave of
        Machpelah, in the field of Ephron the son of Zohar the
        Hittite, which is before Mamre;

025:010 The field which Abraham purchased of the sons of Heth: there
        was Abraham buried, and Sarah his wife.

025:011 And it came to pass after the death of Abraham, that God
        blessed his son Isaac; and Isaac dwelt by the well Lahairoi.

025:012 Now these are the generations of Ishmael, Abraham's son, whom
        Hagar the Egyptian, Sarah's handmaid, bare unto Abraham:

025:013 And these are the names of the sons of Ishmael, by their
        names, according to their generations: the firstborn of
        Ishmael, Nebajoth; and Kedar, and Adbeel, and Mibsam,

025:014 And Mishma, and Dumah, and Massa,

025:015 Hadar, and Tema, Jetur, Naphish, and Kedemah:

025:016 These are the sons of Ishmael, and these are their names, by
        their towns, and by their castles; twelve princes according to
        their nations.

025:017 And these are the years of the life of Ishmael, an hundred and
        thirty and seven years: and he gave up the ghost and died; and
        was gathered unto his people.

025:018 And they dwelt from Havilah unto Shur, that is before Egypt,
        as thou goest toward Assyria: and he died in the presence of
        all his brethren.

025:019 And these are the generations of Isaac, Abraham's son: Abraham
        begat Isaac:

025:020 And Isaac was forty years old when he took Rebekah to wife,
        the daughter of Bethuel the Syrian of Padanaram, the sister to
        Laban the Syrian.

025:021 And Isaac intreated the LORD for his wife, because she was
        barren: and the LORD was intreated of him, and Rebekah his
        wife conceived.

025:022 And the children struggled together within her; and she said,
        If it be so, why am I thus? And she went to enquire of the
        LORD.

025:023 And the LORD said unto her, Two nations are in thy womb, and
        two manner of people shall be separated from thy bowels; and
        the one people shall be stronger than the other people; and
        the elder shall serve the younger.

025:024 And when her days to be delivered were fulfilled, behold,
        there were twins in her womb.

025:025 And the first came out red, all over like an hairy garment;
        and they called his name Esau.

025:026 And after that came his brother out, and his hand took hold on
        Esau's heel; and his name was called Jacob: and Isaac was
        threescore years old when she bare them.

025:027 And the boys grew: and Esau was a cunning hunter, a man of the
        field; and Jacob was a plain man, dwelling in tents.

025:028 And Isaac loved Esau, because he did eat of his venison: but
        Rebekah loved Jacob.

025:029 And Jacob sod pottage: and Esau came from the field, and he
        was faint:

025:030 And Esau said to Jacob, Feed me, I pray thee, with that same
        red pottage; for I am faint: therefore was his name called
        Edom.

025:031 And Jacob said, Sell me this day thy birthright.

025:032 And Esau said, Behold, I am at the point to die: and what
        profit shall this birthright do to me?

025:033 And Jacob said, Swear to me this day; and he sware unto him:
        and he sold his birthright unto Jacob.

025:034 Then Jacob gave Esau bread and pottage of lentiles; and he did
        eat and drink, and rose up, and went his way: thus Esau
        despised his birthright.

026:001 And there was a famine in the land, beside the first famine
        that was in the days of Abraham. And Isaac went unto Abimelech
        king of the Philistines unto Gerar.

026:002 And the LORD appeared unto him, and said, Go not down into
        Egypt; dwell in the land which I shall tell thee of:

026:003 Sojourn in this land, and I will be with thee, and will bless
        thee; for unto thee, and unto thy seed, I will give all these
        countries, and I will perform the oath which I sware unto
        Abraham thy father;

026:004 And I will make thy seed to multiply as the stars of heaven,
        and will give unto thy seed all these countries; and in thy
        seed shall all the nations of the earth be blessed;

026:005 Because that Abraham obeyed my voice, and kept my charge, my
        commandments, my statutes, and my laws.

026:006 And Isaac dwelt in Gerar:

026:007 And the men of the place asked him of his wife; and he said,
        She is my sister: for he feared to say, She is my wife; lest,
        said he, the men of the place should kill me for Rebekah;
        because she was fair to look upon.

026:008 And it came to pass, when he had been there a long time, that
        Abimelech king of the Philistines looked out at a window, and
        saw, and, behold, Isaac was sporting with Rebekah his wife.

026:009 And Abimelech called Isaac, and said, Behold, of a surety she
        is thy wife; and how saidst thou, She is my sister? And Isaac
        said unto him, Because I said, Lest I die for her.

026:010 And Abimelech said, What is this thou hast done unto us? one
        of the people might lightly have lien with thy wife, and thou
        shouldest have brought guiltiness upon us.

026:011 And Abimelech charged all his people, saying, He that toucheth
        this man or his wife shall surely be put to death.

026:012 Then Isaac sowed in that land, and received in the same year
        an hundredfold: and the LORD blessed him.

026:013 And the man waxed great, and went forward, and grew until he
        became very great:

026:014 For he had possession of flocks, and possession of herds, and
        great store of servants: and the Philistines envied him.

026:015 For all the wells which his father's servants had digged in
        the days of Abraham his father, the Philistines had stopped
        them, and filled them with earth.

026:016 And Abimelech said unto Isaac, Go from us; for thou art much
        mightier than we.

026:017 And Isaac departed thence, and pitched his tent in the valley
        of Gerar, and dwelt there.

026:018 And Isaac digged again the wells of water, which they had
        digged in the days of Abraham his father; for the Philistines
        had stopped them after the death of Abraham: and he called
        their names after the names by which his father had called
        them.

026:019 And Isaac's servants digged in the valley, and found there a
        well of springing water.

026:020 And the herdmen of Gerar did strive with Isaac's herdmen,
        saying, The water is ours: and he called the name of the well
        Esek; because they strove with him.

026:021 And they digged another well, and strove for that also: and he
        called the name of it Sitnah.

026:022 And he removed from thence, and digged another well; and for
        that they strove not: and he called the name of it Rehoboth;
        and he said, For now the LORD hath made room for us, and we
        shall be fruitful in the land.

026:023 And he went up from thence to Beersheba.

026:024 And the LORD appeared unto him the same night, and said, I am
        the God of Abraham thy father: fear not, for I am with thee,
        and will bless thee, and multiply thy seed for my servant
        Abraham's sake.

026:025 And he builded an altar there, and called upon the name of the
        LORD, and pitched his tent there: and there Isaac's servants
        digged a well.

026:026 Then Abimelech went to him from Gerar, and Ahuzzath one of his
        friends, and Phichol the chief captain of his army.

026:027 And Isaac said unto them, Wherefore come ye to me, seeing ye
        hate me, and have sent me away from you?

026:028 And they said, We saw certainly that the LORD was with thee:
        and we said, Let there be now an oath betwixt us, even betwixt
        us and thee, and let us make a covenant with thee;

026:029 That thou wilt do us no hurt, as we have not touched thee, and
        as we have done unto thee nothing but good, and have sent thee
        away in peace: thou art now the blessed of the LORD.

026:030 And he made them a feast, and they did eat and drink.

026:031 And they rose up betimes in the morning, and sware one to
        another: and Isaac sent them away, and they departed from him
        in peace.

026:032 And it came to pass the same day, that Isaac's servants came,
        and told him concerning the well which they had digged, and
        said unto him, We have found water.

026:033 And he called it Shebah: therefore the name of the city is
        Beersheba unto this day.

026:034 And Esau was forty years old when he took to wife Judith the
        daughter of Beeri the Hittite, and Bashemath the daughter of
        Elon the Hittite:

026:035 Which were a grief of mind unto Isaac and to Rebekah.

027:001 And it came to pass, that when Isaac was old, and his eyes
        were dim, so that he could not see, he called Esau his eldest
        son, and said unto him, My son: and he said unto him, Behold,
        here am I.

027:002 And he said, Behold now, I am old, I know not the day of my
        death:

027:003 Now therefore take, I pray thee, thy weapons, thy quiver and
        thy bow, and go out to the field, and take me some venison;

027:004 And make me savoury meat, such as I love, and bring it to me,
        that I may eat; that my soul may bless thee before I die.

027:005 And Rebekah heard when Isaac spake to Esau his son. And Esau
        went to the field to hunt for venison, and to bring it.

027:006 And Rebekah spake unto Jacob her son, saying, Behold, I heard
        thy father speak unto Esau thy brother, saying,

027:007 Bring me venison, and make me savoury meat, that I may eat,
        and bless thee before the LORD before my death.

027:008 Now therefore, my son, obey my voice according to that which I
        command thee.

027:009 Go now to the flock, and fetch me from thence two good kids of
        the goats; and I will make them savoury meat for thy father,
        such as he loveth:

027:010 And thou shalt bring it to thy father, that he may eat, and
        that he may bless thee before his death.

027:011 And Jacob said to Rebekah his mother, Behold, Esau my brother
        is a hairy man, and I am a smooth man:

027:012 My father peradventure will feel me, and I shall seem to him
        as a deceiver; and I shall bring a curse upon me, and not a
        blessing.

027:013 And his mother said unto him, Upon me be thy curse, my son:
        only obey my voice, and go fetch me them.

027:014 And he went, and fetched, and brought them to his mother: and
        his mother made savoury meat, such as his father loved.

027:015 And Rebekah took goodly raiment of her eldest son Esau, which
        were with her in the house, and put them upon Jacob her
        younger son:

027:016 And she put the skins of the kids of the goats upon his hands,
        and upon the smooth of his neck:

027:017 And she gave the savoury meat and the bread, which she had
        prepared, into the hand of her son Jacob.

027:018 And he came unto his father, and said, My father: and he said,
        Here am I; who art thou, my son?

027:019 And Jacob said unto his father, I am Esau thy first born; I
        have done according as thou badest me: arise, I pray thee, sit
        and eat of my venison, that thy soul may bless me.

027:020 And Isaac said unto his son, How is it that thou hast found it
        so quickly, my son? And he said, Because the LORD thy God
        brought it to me.

027:021 And Isaac said unto Jacob, Come near, I pray thee, that I may
        feel thee, my son, whether thou be my very son Esau or not.

027:022 And Jacob went near unto Isaac his father; and he felt him,
        and said, The voice is Jacob's voice, but the hands are the
        hands of Esau.

027:023 And he discerned him not, because his hands were hairy, as his
        brother Esau's hands: so he blessed him.

027:024 And he said, Art thou my very son Esau? And he said, I am.

027:025 And he said, Bring it near to me, and I will eat of my son's
        venison, that my soul may bless thee. And he brought it near
        to him, and he did eat: and he brought him wine and he drank.

027:026 And his father Isaac said unto him, Come near now, and kiss
        me, my son.

027:027 And he came near, and kissed him: and he smelled the smell of
        his raiment, and blessed him, and said, See, the smell of my
        son is as the smell of a field which the LORD hath blessed:

027:028 Therefore God give thee of the dew of heaven, and the fatness
        of the earth, and plenty of corn and wine:

027:029 Let people serve thee, and nations bow down to thee: be lord
        over thy brethren, and let thy mother's sons bow down to thee:
        cursed be every one that curseth thee, and blessed be he that
        blesseth thee.

027:030 And it came to pass, as soon as Isaac had made an end of
        blessing Jacob, and Jacob was yet scarce gone out from the
        presence of Isaac his father, that Esau his brother came in
        from his hunting.

027:031 And he also had made savoury meat, and brought it unto his
        father, and said unto his father, Let my father arise, and eat
        of his son's venison, that thy soul may bless me.

027:032 And Isaac his father said unto him, Who art thou? And he said,
        I am thy son, thy firstborn Esau.

027:033 And Isaac trembled very exceedingly, and said, Who? where is
        he that hath taken venison, and brought it me, and I have
        eaten of all before thou camest, and have blessed him? yea,
        and he shall be blessed.

027:034 And when Esau heard the words of his father, he cried with a
        great and exceeding bitter cry, and said unto his father,
        Bless me, even me also, O my father.

027:035 And he said, Thy brother came with subtilty, and hath taken
        away thy blessing.

027:036 And he said, Is not he rightly named Jacob? for he hath
        supplanted me these two times: he took away my birthright;
        and, behold, now he hath taken away my blessing. And he said,
        Hast thou not reserved a blessing for me?

027:037 And Isaac answered and said unto Esau, Behold, I have made him
        thy lord, and all his brethren have I given to him for
        servants; and with corn and wine have I sustained him: and
        what shall I do now unto thee, my son?

027:038 And Esau said unto his father, Hast thou but one blessing, my
        father? bless me, even me also, O my father. And Esau lifted
        up his voice, and wept.

027:039 And Isaac his father answered and said unto him, Behold, thy
        dwelling shall be the fatness of the earth, and of the dew of
        heaven from above;

027:040 And by thy sword shalt thou live, and shalt serve thy brother;
        and it shall come to pass when thou shalt have the dominion,
        that thou shalt break his yoke from off thy neck.

027:041 And Esau hated Jacob because of the blessing wherewith his
        father blessed him: and Esau said in his heart, The days of
        mourning for my father are at hand; then will I slay my
        brother Jacob.

027:042 And these words of Esau her elder son were told to Rebekah:
        and she sent and called Jacob her younger son, and said unto
        him, Behold, thy brother Esau, as touching thee, doth comfort
        himself, purposing to kill thee.

027:043 Now therefore, my son, obey my voice; arise, flee thou to
        Laban my brother to Haran;

027:044 And tarry with him a few days, until thy brother's fury turn
        away;

027:045 Until thy brother's anger turn away from thee, and he forget
        that which thou hast done to him: then I will send, and fetch
        thee from thence: why should I be deprived also of you both in
        one day?

027:046 And Rebekah said to Isaac, I am weary of my life because of
        the daughters of Heth: if Jacob take a wife of the daughters
        of Heth, such as these which are of the daughters of the land,
        what good shall my life do me?

028:001 And Isaac called Jacob, and blessed him, and charged him, and
        said unto him, Thou shalt not take a wife of the daughters of
        Canaan.

028:002 Arise, go to Padanaram, to the house of Bethuel thy mother's
        father; and take thee a wife from thence of the daughers of
        Laban thy mother's brother.

028:003 And God Almighty bless thee, and make thee fruitful, and
        multiply thee, that thou mayest be a multitude of people;

028:004 And give thee the blessing of Abraham, to thee, and to thy
        seed with thee; that thou mayest inherit the land wherein thou
        art a stranger, which God gave unto Abraham.

028:005 And Isaac sent away Jacob: and he went to Padanaram unto
        Laban, son of Bethuel the Syrian, the brother of Rebekah,
        Jacob's and Esau's mother.

028:006 When Esau saw that Isaac had blessed Jacob, and sent him away
        to Padanaram, to take him a wife from thence; and that as he
        blessed him he gave him a charge, saying, Thou shalt not take
        a wife of the daughers of Canaan;

028:007 And that Jacob obeyed his father and his mother, and was gone
        to Padanaram;

028:008 And Esau seeing that the daughters of Canaan pleased not Isaac
        his father;

028:009 Then went Esau unto Ishmael, and took unto the wives which he
        had Mahalath the daughter of Ishmael Abraham's son, the sister
        of Nebajoth, to be his wife.

028:010 And Jacob went out from Beersheba, and went toward Haran.

028:011 And he lighted upon a certain place, and tarried there all
        night, because the sun was set; and he took of the stones of
        that place, and put them for his pillows, and lay down in that
        place to sleep.

028:012 And he dreamed, and behold a ladder set up on the earth, and
        the top of it reached to heaven: and behold the angels of God
        ascending and descending on it.

028:013 And, behold, the LORD stood above it, and said, I am the LORD
        God of Abraham thy father, and the God of Isaac: the land
        whereon thou liest, to thee will I give it, and to thy seed;

028:014 And thy seed shall be as the dust of the earth, and thou shalt
        spread abroad to the west, and to the east, and to the north,
        and to the south: and in thee and in thy seed shall all the
        families of the earth be blessed.

028:015 And, behold, I am with thee, and will keep thee in all places
        whither thou goest, and will bring thee again into this land;
        for I will not leave thee, until I have done that which I have
        spoken to thee of.

028:016 And Jacob awaked out of his sleep, and he said, Surely the
        LORD is in this place; and I knew it not.

028:017 And he was afraid, and said, How dreadful is this place! this
        is none other but the house of God, and this is the gate of
        heaven.

028:018 And Jacob rose up early in the morning, and took the stone
        that he had put for his pillows, and set it up for a pillar,
        and poured oil upon the top of it.

028:019 And he called the name of that place Bethel: but the name of
        that city was called Luz at the first.

028:020 And Jacob vowed a vow, saying, If God will be with me, and
        will keep me in this way that I go, and will give me bread to
        eat, and raiment to put on,

028:021 So that I come again to my father's house in peace; then shall
        the LORD be my God:

028:022 And this stone, which I have set for a pillar, shall be God's
        house: and of all that thou shalt give me I will surely give
        the tenth unto thee.

029:001 Then Jacob went on his journey, and came into the land of the
        people of the east.

029:002 And he looked, and behold a well in the field, and, lo, there
        were three flocks of sheep lying by it; for out of that well
        they watered the flocks: and a great stone was upon the well's
        mouth.

029:003 And thither were all the flocks gathered: and they rolled the
        stone from the well's mouth, and watered the sheep, and put
        the stone again upon the well's mouth in his place.

029:004 And Jacob said unto them, My brethren, whence be ye? And they
        said, Of Haran are we.

029:005 And he said unto them, Know ye Laban the son of Nahor? And
        they said, We know him.

029:006 And he said unto them, Is he well? And they said, He is well:
        and, behold, Rachel his daughter cometh with the sheep.

029:007 And he said, Lo, it is yet high day, neither is it time that
        the cattle should be gathered together: water ye the sheep,
        and go and feed them.

029:008 And they said, We cannot, until all the flocks be gathered
        together, and till they roll the stone from the well's mouth;
        then we water the sheep.

029:009 And while he yet spake with them, Rachel came with her
        father's sheep; for she kept them.

029:010 And it came to pass, when Jacob saw Rachel the daughter of
        Laban his mother's brother, and the sheep of Laban his
        mother's brother, that Jacob went near, and rolled the stone
        from the well's mouth, and watered the flock of Laban his
        mother's brother.

029:011 And Jacob kissed Rachel, and lifted up his voice, and wept.

029:012 And Jacob told Rachel that he was her father's brother, and
        that he was Rebekah's son: and she ran and told her father.

029:013 And it came to pass, when Laban heard the tidings of Jacob his
        sister's son, that he ran to meet him, and embraced him, and
        kissed him, and brought him to his house. And he told Laban
        all these things.

029:014 And Laban said to him, Surely thou art my bone and my flesh.
        And he abode with him the space of a month.

029:015 And Laban said unto Jacob, Because thou art my brother,
        shouldest thou therefore serve me for nought? tell me, what
        shall thy wages be?

029:016 And Laban had two daughters: the name of the elder was Leah,
        and the name of the younger was Rachel.

029:017 Leah was tender eyed; but Rachel was beautiful and well
        favoured.

029:018 And Jacob loved Rachel; and said, I will serve thee seven
        years for Rachel thy younger daughter.

029:019 And Laban said, It is better that I give her to thee, than
        that I should give her to another man: abide with me.

029:020 And Jacob served seven years for Rachel; and they seemed unto
        him but a few days, for the love he had to her.

029:021 And Jacob said unto Laban, Give me my wife, for my days are
        fulfilled, that I may go in unto her.

029:022 And Laban gathered together all the men of the place, and made
        a feast.

029:023 And it came to pass in the evening, that he took Leah his
        daughter, and brought her to him; and he went in unto her.

029:024 And Laban gave unto his daughter Leah Zilpah his maid for an
        handmaid.

029:025 And it came to pass, that in the morning, behold, it was Leah:
        and he said to Laban, What is this thou hast done unto me? did
        not I serve with thee for Rachel? wherefore then hast thou
        beguiled me?

029:026 And Laban said, It must not be so done in our country, to give
        the younger before the firstborn.

029:027 Fulfil her week, and we will give thee this also for the
        service which thou shalt serve with me yet seven other years.

029:028 And Jacob did so, and fulfilled her week: and he gave him
        Rachel his daughter to wife also.

029:029 And Laban gave to Rachel his daughter Bilhah his handmaid to
        be her maid.

029:030 And he went in also unto Rachel, and he loved also Rachel more
        than Leah, and served with him yet seven other years.

029:031 And when the LORD saw that Leah was hated, he opened her womb:
        but Rachel was barren.

029:032 And Leah conceived, and bare a son, and she called his name
        Reuben: for she said, Surely the LORD hath looked upon my
        affliction; now therefore my husband will love me.

029:033 And she conceived again, and bare a son; and said, Because the
        LORD hath heard I was hated, he hath therefore given me this
        son also: and she called his name Simeon.

029:034 And she conceived again, and bare a son; and said, Now this
        time will my husband be joined unto me, because I have born
        him three sons: therefore was his name called Levi.

029:035 And she conceived again, and bare a son: and she said, Now
        will I praise the LORD: therefore she called his name Judah;
        and left bearing.

030:001 And when Rachel saw that she bare Jacob no children, Rachel
        envied her sister; and said unto Jacob, Give me children, or
        else I die.

030:002 And Jacob's anger was kindled against Rachel: and he said, Am
        I in God's stead, who hath withheld from thee the fruit of the
        womb?

030:003 And she said, Behold my maid Bilhah, go in unto her; and she
        shall bear upon my knees, that I may also have children by
        her.

030:004 And she gave him Bilhah her handmaid to wife: and Jacob went
        in unto her.

030:005 And Bilhah conceived, and bare Jacob a son.

030:006 And Rachel said, God hath judged me, and hath also heard my
        voice, and hath given me a son: therefore called she his name
        Dan.

030:007 And Bilhah Rachel's maid conceived again, and bare Jacob a
        second son.

030:008 And Rachel said, With great wrestlings have I wrestled with my
        sister, and I have prevailed: and she called his name
        Naphtali.

030:009 When Leah saw that she had left bearing, she took Zilpah her
        maid, and gave her Jacob to wife.

030:010 And Zilpah Leah's maid bare Jacob a son.

030:011 And Leah said, A troop cometh: and she called his name Gad.

030:012 And Zilpah Leah's maid bare Jacob a second son.

030:013 And Leah said, Happy am I, for the daughters will call me
        blessed: and she called his name Asher.

030:014 And Reuben went in the days of wheat harvest, and found
        mandrakes in the field, and brought them unto his mother Leah.
        Then Rachel said to Leah, Give me, I pray thee, of thy son's
        mandrakes.

030:015 And she said unto her, Is it a small matter that thou hast
        taken my husband? and wouldest thou take away my son's
        mandrakes also? And Rachel said, Therefore he shall lie with
        thee to night for thy son's mandrakes.

030:016 And Jacob came out of the field in the evening, and Leah went
        out to meet him, and said, Thou must come in unto me; for
        surely I have hired thee with my son's mandrakes. And he lay
        with her that night.

030:017 And God hearkened unto Leah, and she conceived, and bare Jacob
        the fifth son.

030:018 And Leah said, God hath given me my hire, because I have given
        my maiden to my husband: and she called his name Issachar.

030:019 And Leah conceived again, and bare Jacob the sixth son.

030:020 And Leah said, God hath endued me with a good dowry; now will
        my husband dwell with me, because I have born him six sons:
        and she called his name Zebulun.

030:021 And afterwards she bare a daughter, and called her name Dinah.

030:022 And God remembered Rachel, and God hearkened to her, and
        opened her womb.

030:023 And she conceived, and bare a son; and said, God hath taken
        away my reproach:

030:024 And she called his name Joseph; and said, The LORD shall add
        to me another son.

030:025 And it came to pass, when Rachel had born Joseph, that Jacob
        said unto Laban, Send me away, that I may go unto mine own
        place, and to my country.

030:026 Give me my wives and my children, for whom I have served thee,
        and let me go: for thou knowest my service which I have done
        thee.

030:027 And Laban said unto him, I pray thee, if I have found favour
        in thine eyes, tarry: for I have learned by experience that
        the LORD hath blessed me for thy sake.

030:028 And he said, Appoint me thy wages, and I will give it.

030:029 And he said unto him, Thou knowest how I have served thee, and
        how thy cattle was with me.

030:030 For it was little which thou hadst before I came, and it is
        now increased unto a multitude; and the LORD hath blessed thee
        since my coming: and now when shall I provide for mine own
        house also?

030:031 And he said, What shall I give thee? And Jacob said, Thou
        shalt not give me any thing: if thou wilt do this thing for
        me, I will again feed and keep thy flock.

030:032 I will pass through all thy flock to day, removing from thence
        all the speckled and spotted cattle, and all the brown cattle
        among the sheep, and the spotted and speckled among the goats:
        and of such shall be my hire.

030:033 So shall my righteousness answer for me in time to come, when
        it shall come for my hire before thy face: every one that is
        not speckled and spotted among the goats, and brown among the
        sheep, that shall be counted stolen with me.

030:034 And Laban said, Behold, I would it might be according to thy
        word.

030:035 And he removed that day the he goats that were ringstraked and
        spotted, and all the she goats that were speckled and spotted,
        and every one that had some white in it, and all the brown
        among the sheep, and gave them into the hand of his sons.

030:036 And he set three days' journey betwixt himself and Jacob: and
        Jacob fed the rest of Laban's flocks.

030:037 And Jacob took him rods of green poplar, and of the hazel and
        chesnut tree; and pilled white strakes in them, and made the
        white appear which was in the rods.

030:038 And he set the rods which he had pilled before the flocks in
        the gutters in the watering troughs when the flocks came to
        drink, that they should conceive when they came to drink.

030:039 And the flocks conceived before the rods, and brought forth
        cattle ringstraked, speckled, and spotted.

030:040 And Jacob did separate the lambs, and set the faces of the
        flocks toward the ringstraked, and all the brown in the flock
        of Laban; and he put his own flocks by themselves, and put
        them not unto Laban's cattle.

030:041 And it came to pass, whensoever the stronger cattle did
        conceive, that Jacob laid the rods before the eyes of the
        cattle in the gutters, that they might conceive among the
        rods.

030:042 But when the cattle were feeble, he put them not in: so the
        feebler were Laban's, and the stronger Jacob's.

030:043 And the man increased exceedingly, and had much cattle, and
        maidservants, and menservants, and camels, and asses.

031:001 And he heard the words of Laban's sons, saying, Jacob hath
        taken away all that was our father's; and of that which was
        our father's hath he gotten all this glory.

031:002 And Jacob beheld the countenance of Laban, and, behold, it was
        not toward him as before.

031:003 And the LORD said unto Jacob, Return unto the land of thy
        fathers, and to thy kindred; and I will be with thee.

031:004 And Jacob sent and called Rachel and Leah to the field unto
        his flock,

031:005 And said unto them, I see your father's countenance, that it
        is not toward me as before; but the God of my father hath been
        with me.

031:006 And ye know that with all my power I have served your father.

031:007 And your father hath deceived me, and changed my wages ten
        times; but God suffered him not to hurt me.

031:008 If he said thus, The speckled shall be thy wages; then all the
        cattle bare speckled: and if he said thus, The ringstraked
        shall be thy hire; then bare all the cattle ringstraked.

031:009 Thus God hath taken away the cattle of your father, and given
        them to me.

031:010 And it came to pass at the time that the cattle conceived,
        that I lifted up mine eyes, and saw in a dream, and, behold,
        the rams which leaped upon the cattle were ringstraked,
        speckled, and grisled.

031:011 And the angel of God spake unto me in a dream, saying, Jacob:
        And I said, Here am I.

031:012 And he said, Lift up now thine eyes, and see, all the rams
        which leap upon the cattle are ringstraked, speckled, and
        grisled: for I have seen all that Laban doeth unto thee.

031:013 I am the God of Bethel, where thou anointedst the pillar, and
        where thou vowedst a vow unto me: now arise, get thee out from
        this land, and return unto the land of thy kindred.

031:014 And Rachel and Leah answered and said unto him, Is there yet
        any portion or inheritance for us in our father's house?

031:015 Are we not counted of him strangers? for he hath sold us, and
        hath quite devoured also our money.

031:016 For all the riches which God hath taken from our father, that
        is ours, and our children's: now then, whatsoever God hath
        said unto thee, do.

031:017 Then Jacob rose up, and set his sons and his wives upon
        camels;

031:018 And he carried away all his cattle, and all his goods which he
        had gotten, the cattle of his getting, which he had gotten in
        Padanaram, for to go to Isaac his father in the land of
        Canaan.

031:019 And Laban went to shear his sheep: and Rachel had stolen the
        images that were her father's.

031:020 And Jacob stole away unawares to Laban the Syrian, in that he
        told him not that he fled.

031:021 So he fled with all that he had; and he rose up, and passed
        over the river, and set his face toward the mount Gilead.

031:022 And it was told Laban on the third day that Jacob was fled.

031:023 And he took his brethren with him, and pursued after him seven
        days' journey; and they overtook him in the mount Gilead.

031:024 And God came to Laban the Syrian in a dream by night, and said
        unto him, Take heed that thou speak not to Jacob either good
        or bad.

031:025 Then Laban overtook Jacob. Now Jacob had pitched his tent in
        the mount: and Laban with his brethren pitched in the mount of
        Gilead.

031:026 And Laban said to Jacob, What hast thou done, that thou hast
        stolen away unawares to me, and carried away my daughters, as
        captives taken with the sword?

031:027 Wherefore didst thou flee away secretly, and steal away from
        me; and didst not tell me, that I might have sent thee away
        with mirth, and with songs, with tabret, and with harp?

031:028 And hast not suffered me to kiss my sons and my daughters?
        thou hast now done foolishly in so doing.

031:029 It is in the power of my hand to do you hurt: but the God of
        your father spake unto me yesternight, saying, Take thou heed
        that thou speak not to Jacob either good or bad.

031:030 And now, though thou wouldest needs be gone, because thou sore
        longedst after thy father's house, yet wherefore hast thou
        stolen my gods?

031:031 And Jacob answered and said to Laban, Because I was afraid:
        for I said, Peradventure thou wouldest take by force thy
        daughters from me.

031:032 With whomsoever thou findest thy gods, let him not live:
        before our brethren discern thou what is thine with me, and
        take it to thee. For Jacob knew not that Rachel had stolen
        them.

031:033 And Laban went into Jacob's tent, and into Leah's tent, and
        into the two maidservants' tents; but he found them not. Then
        went he out of Leah's tent, and entered into Rachel's tent.

031:034 Now Rachel had taken the images, and put them in the camel's
        furniture, and sat upon them. And Laban searched all the tent,
        but found them not.

031:035 And she said to her father, Let it not displease my lord that
        I cannot rise up before thee; for the custom of women is upon
        me. And he searched but found not the images.

031:036 And Jacob was wroth, and chode with Laban: and Jacob answered
        and said to Laban, What is my trespass? what is my sin, that
        thou hast so hotly pursued after me?

031:037 Whereas thou hast searched all my stuff, what hast thou found
        of all thy household stuff? set it here before my brethren and
        thy brethren, that they may judge betwixt us both.

031:038 This twenty years have I been with thee; thy ewes and thy she
        goats have not cast their young, and the rams of thy flock
        have I not eaten.

031:039 That which was torn of beasts I brought not unto thee; I bare
        the loss of it; of my hand didst thou require it, whether
        stolen by day, or stolen by night.

031:040 Thus I was; in the day the drought consumed me, and the frost
        by night; and my sleep departed from mine eyes.

031:041 Thus have I been twenty years in thy house; I served thee
        fourteen years for thy two daughters, and six years for thy
        cattle: and thou hast changed my wages ten times.

031:042 Except the God of my father, the God of Abraham, and the fear
        of Isaac, had been with me, surely thou hadst sent me away now
        empty. God hath seen mine affliction and the labour of my
        hands, and rebuked thee yesternight.

031:043 And Laban answered and said unto Jacob, These daughters are my
        daughters, and these children are my children, and these
        cattle are my cattle, and all that thou seest is mine: and
        what can I do this day unto these my daughters, or unto their
        children which they have born?

031:044 Now therefore come thou, let us make a covenant, I and thou;
        and let it be for a witness between me and thee.

031:045 And Jacob took a stone, and set it up for a pillar.

031:046 And Jacob said unto his brethren, Gather stones; and they took
        stones, and made an heap: and they did eat there upon the
        heap.

031:047 And Laban called it Jegarsahadutha: but Jacob called it
        Galeed.

031:048 And Laban said, This heap is a witness between me and thee
        this day. Therefore was the name of it called Galeed;

031:049 And Mizpah; for he said, The LORD watch between me and thee,
        when we are absent one from another.

031:050 If thou shalt afflict my daughters, or if thou shalt take
        other wives beside my daughters, no man is with us; see, God
        is witness betwixt me and thee.

031:051 And Laban said to Jacob, Behold this heap, and behold this
        pillar, which I have cast betwixt me and thee:

031:052 This heap be witness, and this pillar be witness, that I will
        not pass over this heap to thee, and that thou shalt not pass
        over this heap and this pillar unto me, for harm.

031:053 The God of Abraham, and the God of Nahor, the God of their
        father, judge betwixt us. And Jacob sware by the fear of his
        father Isaac.

031:054 Then Jacob offered sacrifice upon the mount, and called his
        brethren to eat bread: and they did eat bread, and tarried all
        night in the mount.

031:055 And early in the morning Laban rose up, and kissed his sons
        and his daughters, and blessed them: and Laban departed, and
        returned unto his place.

032:001 And Jacob went on his way, and the angels of God met him.

032:002 And when Jacob saw them, he said, This is God's host: and he
        called the name of that place Mahanaim.

032:003 And Jacob sent messengers before him to Esau his brother unto
        the land of Seir, the country of Edom.

032:004 And he commanded them, saying, Thus shall ye speak unto my
        lord Esau; Thy servant Jacob saith thus, I have sojourned with
        Laban, and stayed there until now:

032:005 And I have oxen, and asses, flocks, and menservants, and
        womenservants: and I have sent to tell my lord, that I may
        find grace in thy sight.

032:006 And the messengers returned to Jacob, saying, We came to thy
        brother Esau, and also he cometh to meet thee, and four
        hundred men with him.

032:007 Then Jacob was greatly afraid and distressed: and he divided
        the people that was with him, and the flocks, and herds, and
        the camels, into two bands;

032:008 And said, If Esau come to the one company, and smite it, then
        the other company which is left shall escape.

032:009 And Jacob said, O God of my father Abraham, and God of my
        father Isaac, the LORD which saidst unto me, Return unto thy
        country, and to thy kindred, and I will deal well with thee:

032:010 I am not worthy of the least of all the mercies, and of all
        the truth, which thou hast shewed unto thy servant; for with
        my staff I passed over this Jordan; and now I am become two
        bands.

032:011 Deliver me, I pray thee, from the hand of my brother, from the
        hand of Esau: for I fear him, lest he will come and smite me,
        and the mother with the children.

032:012 And thou saidst, I will surely do thee good, and make thy seed
        as the sand of the sea, which cannot be numbered for
        multitude.

032:013 And he lodged there that same night; and took of that which
        came to his hand a present for Esau his brother;

032:014 Two hundred she goats, and twenty he goats, two hundred ewes,
        and twenty rams,

032:015 Thirty milch camels with their colts, forty kine, and ten
        bulls, twenty she asses, and ten foals.

032:016 And he delivered them into the hand of his servants, every
        drove by themselves; and said unto his servants, Pass over
        before me, and put a space betwixt drove and drove.

032:017 And he commanded the foremost, saying, When Esau my brother
        meeteth thee, and asketh thee, saying, Whose art thou? and
        whither goest thou? and whose are these before thee?

032:018 Then thou shalt say, They be thy servant Jacob's; it is a
        present sent unto my lord Esau: and, behold, also he is behind
        us.

032:019 And so commanded he the second, and the third, and all that
        followed the droves, saying, On this manner shall ye speak
        unto Esau, when ye find him.

032:020 And say ye moreover, Behold, thy servant Jacob is behind us.
        For he said, I will appease him with the present that goeth
        before me, and afterward I will see his face; peradventure he
        will accept of me.

032:021 So went the present over before him: and himself lodged that
        night in the company.

032:022 And he rose up that night, and took his two wives, and his two
        womenservants, and his eleven sons, and passed over the ford
        Jabbok.

032:023 And he took them, and sent them over the brook, and sent over
        that he had.

032:024 And Jacob was left alone; and there wrestled a man with him
        until the breaking of the day.

032:025 And when he saw that he prevailed not against him, he touched
        the hollow of his thigh; and the hollow of Jacob's thigh was
        out of joint, as he wrestled with him.

032:026 And he said, Let me go, for the day breaketh. And he said, I
        will not let thee go, except thou bless me.

032:027 And he said unto him, What is thy name? And he said, Jacob.

032:028 And he said, Thy name shall be called no more Jacob, but
        Israel: for as a prince hast thou power with God and with men,
        and hast prevailed.

032:029 And Jacob asked him, and said, Tell me, I pray thee, thy name.
        And he said, Wherefore is it that thou dost ask after my name?
        And he blessed him there.

032:030 And Jacob called the name of the place Peniel: for I have seen
        God face to face, and my life is preserved.

032:031 And as he passed over Penuel the sun rose upon him, and he
        halted upon his thigh.

032:032 Therefore the children of Israel eat not of the sinew which
        shrank, which is upon the hollow of the thigh, unto this day:
        because he touched the hollow of Jacob's thigh in the sinew
        that shrank.

033:001 And Jacob lifted up his eyes, and looked, and, behold, Esau
        came, and with him four hundred men. And he divided the
        children unto Leah, and unto Rachel, and unto the two
        handmaids.

033:002 And he put the handmaids and their children foremost, and Leah
        and her children after, and Rachel and Joseph hindermost.

033:003 And he passed over before them, and bowed himself to the
        ground seven times, until he came near to his brother.

033:004 And Esau ran to meet him, and embraced him, and fell on his
        neck, and kissed him: and they wept.

033:005 And he lifted up his eyes, and saw the women and the children;
        and said, Who are those with thee? And he said, The children
        which God hath graciously given thy servant.

033:006 Then the handmaidens came near, they and their children, and
        they bowed themselves.

033:007 And Leah also with her children came near, and bowed
        themselves: and after came Joseph near and Rachel, and they
        bowed themselves.

033:008 And he said, What meanest thou by all this drove which I met?
        And he said, These are to find grace in the sight of my lord.

033:009 And Esau said, I have enough, my brother; keep that thou hast
        unto thyself.

033:010 And Jacob said, Nay, I pray thee, if now I have found grace in
        thy sight, then receive my present at my hand: for therefore I
        have seen thy face, as though I had seen the face of God, and
        thou wast pleased with me.

033:011 Take, I pray thee, my blessing that is brought to thee;
        because God hath dealt graciously with me, and because I have
        enough. And he urged him, and he took it.

033:012 And he said, Let us take our journey, and let us go, and I
        will go before thee.

033:013 And he said unto him, My lord knoweth that the children are
        tender, and the flocks and herds with young are with me: and
        if men should overdrive them one day, all the flock will die.

033:014 Let my lord, I pray thee, pass over before his servant: and I
        will lead on softly, according as the cattle that goeth before
        me and the children be able to endure, until I come unto my
        lord unto Seir.

033:015 And Esau said, Let me now leave with thee some of the folk
        that are with me. And he said, What needeth it? let me find
        grace in the sight of my lord.

033:016 So Esau returned that day on his way unto Seir.

033:017 And Jacob journeyed to Succoth, and built him an house, and
        made booths for his cattle: therefore the name of the place is
        called Succoth.

033:018 And Jacob came to Shalem, a city of Shechem, which is in the
        land of Canaan, when he came from Padanaram; and pitched his
        tent before the city.

033:019 And he bought a parcel of a field, where he had spread his
        tent, at the hand of the children of Hamor, Shechem's father,
        for an hundred pieces of money.

033:020 And he erected there an altar, and called it EleloheIsrael.

034:001 And Dinah the daughter of Leah, which she bare unto Jacob,
        went out to see the daughters of the land.

034:002 And when Shechem the son of Hamor the Hivite, prince of the
        country, saw her, he took her, and lay with her, and defiled
        her.

034:003 And his soul clave unto Dinah the daughter of Jacob, and he
        loved the damsel, and spake kindly unto the damsel.

034:004 And Shechem spake unto his father Hamor, saying, Get me this
        damsel to wife.

034:005 And Jacob heard that he had defiled Dinah his daughter: now
        his sons were with his cattle in the field: and Jacob held his
        peace until they were come.

034:006 And Hamor the father of Shechem went out unto Jacob to commune
        with him.

034:007 And the sons of Jacob came out of the field when they heard
        it: and the men were grieved, and they were very wroth,
        because he had wrought folly in Israel in lying with Jacob's
        daughter: which thing ought not to be done.

034:008 And Hamor communed with them, saying, The soul of my son
        Shechem longeth for your daughter: I pray you give her him to
        wife.

034:009 And make ye marriages with us, and give your daughters unto
        us, and take our daughters unto you.

034:010 And ye shall dwell with us: and the land shall be before you;
        dwell and trade ye therein, and get you possessions therein.

034:011 And Shechem said unto her father and unto her brethren, Let me
        find grace in your eyes, and what ye shall say unto me I will
        give.

034:012 Ask me never so much dowry and gift, and I will give according
        as ye shall say unto me: but give me the damsel to wife.

034:013 And the sons of Jacob answered Shechem and Hamor his father
        deceitfully, and said, because he had defiled Dinah their
        sister:

034:014 And they said unto them, We cannot do this thing, to give our
        sister to one that is uncircumcised; for that were a reproach
        unto us:

034:015 But in this will we consent unto you: If ye will be as we be,
        that every male of you be circumcised;

034:016 Then will we give our daughters unto you, and we will take
        your daughters to us, and we will dwell with you, and we will
        become one people.

034:017 But if ye will not hearken unto us, to be circumcised; then
        will we take our daughter, and we will be gone.

034:018 And their words pleased Hamor, and Shechem Hamor's son.

034:019 And the young man deferred not to do the thing, because he had
        delight in Jacob's daughter: and he was more honourable than
        all the house of his father.

034:020 And Hamor and Shechem his son came unto the gate of their
        city, and communed with the men of their city, saying,

034:021 These men are peaceable with us; therefore let them dwell in
        the land, and trade therein; for the land, behold, it is large
        enough for them; let us take their daughters to us for wives,
        and let us give them our daughters.

034:022 Only herein will the men consent unto us for to dwell with us,
        to be one people, if every male among us be circumcised, as
        they are circumcised.

034:023 Shall not their cattle and their substance and every beast of
        their's be our's? only let us consent unto them, and they will
        dwell with us.

034:024 And unto Hamor and unto Shechem his son hearkened all that
        went out of the gate of his city; and every male was
        circumcised, all that went out of the gate of his city.

034:025 And it came to pass on the third day, when they were sore,
        that two of the sons of Jacob, Simeon and Levi, Dinah's
        brethren, took each man his sword, and came upon the city
        boldly, and slew all the males.

034:026 And they slew Hamor and Shechem his son with the edge of the
        sword, and took Dinah out of Shechem's house, and went out.

034:027 The sons of Jacob came upon the slain, and spoiled the city,
        because they had defiled their sister.

034:028 They took their sheep, and their oxen, and their asses, and
        that which was in the city, and that which was in the field,

034:029 And all their wealth, and all their little ones, and their
        wives took they captive, and spoiled even all that was in the
        house.

034:030 And Jacob said to Simeon and Levi, Ye have troubled me to make
        me to stink among the inhabitants of the land, among the
        Canaanites and the Perizzites: and I being few in number, they
        shall gather themselves together against me, and slay me; and
        I shall be destroyed, I and my house.

034:031 And they said, Should he deal with our sister as with an
        harlot?

035:001 And God said unto Jacob, Arise, go up to Bethel, and dwell
        there: and make there an altar unto God, that appeared unto
        thee when thou fleddest from the face of Esau thy brother.

035:002 Then Jacob said unto his household, and to all that were with
        him, Put away the strange gods that are among you, and be
        clean, and change your garments:

035:003 And let us arise, and go up to Bethel; and I will make there
        an altar unto God, who answered me in the day of my distress,
        and was with me in the way which I went.

035:004 And they gave unto Jacob all the strange gods which were in
        their hand, and all their earrings which were in their ears;
        and Jacob hid them under the oak which was by Shechem.

035:005 And they journeyed: and the terror of God was upon the cities
        that were round about them, and they did not pursue after the
        sons of Jacob.

035:006 So Jacob came to Luz, which is in the land of Canaan, that is,
        Bethel, he and all the people that were with him.

035:007 And he built there an altar, and called the place Elbethel:
        because there God appeared unto him, when he fled from the
        face of his brother.

035:008 But Deborah Rebekah's nurse died, and she was buried beneath
        Bethel under an oak: and the name of it was called
        Allonbachuth.

035:009 And God appeared unto Jacob again, when he came out of
        Padanaram, and blessed him.

035:010 And God said unto him, Thy name is Jacob: thy name shall not
        be called any more Jacob, but Israel shall be thy name: and he
        called his name Israel.

035:011 And God said unto him, I am God Almighty: be fruitful and
        multiply; a nation and a company of nations shall be of thee,
        and kings shall come out of thy loins;

035:012 And the land which I gave Abraham and Isaac, to thee I will
        give it, and to thy seed after thee will I give the land.

035:013 And God went up from him in the place where he talked with
        him.

035:014 And Jacob set up a pillar in the place where he talked with
        him, even a pillar of stone: and he poured a drink offering
        thereon, and he poured oil thereon.

035:015 And Jacob called the name of the place where God spake with
        him, Bethel.

035:016 And they journeyed from Bethel; and there was but a little way
        to come to Ephrath: and Rachel travailed, and she had hard
        labour.

035:017 And it came to pass, when she was in hard labour, that the
        midwife said unto her, Fear not; thou shalt have this son
        also.

035:018 And it came to pass, as her soul was in departing, (for she
        died) that she called his name Benoni: but his father called
        him Benjamin.

035:019 And Rachel died, and was buried in the way to Ephrath, which
        is Bethlehem.

035:020 And Jacob set a pillar upon her grave: that is the pillar of
        Rachel's grave unto this day.

035:021 And Israel journeyed, and spread his tent beyond the tower of
        Edar.

035:022 And it came to pass, when Israel dwelt in that land, that
        Reuben went and lay with Bilhah his father's concubine: and
        Israel heard it. Now the sons of Jacob were twelve:

035:023 The sons of Leah; Reuben, Jacob's firstborn, and Simeon, and
        Levi, and Judah, and Issachar, and Zebulun:

035:024 The sons of Rachel; Joseph, and Benjamin:

035:025 And the sons of Bilhah, Rachel's handmaid; Dan, and Naphtali:

035:026 And the sons of Zilpah, Leah's handmaid: Gad, and Asher: these
        are the sons of Jacob, which were born to him in Padanaram.

035:027 And Jacob came unto Isaac his father unto Mamre, unto the city
        of Arbah, which is Hebron, where Abraham and Isaac sojourned.

035:028 And the days of Isaac were an hundred and fourscore years.

035:029 And Isaac gave up the ghost, and died, and was gathered unto
        his people, being old and full of days: and his sons Esau and
        Jacob buried him.

036:001 Now these are the generations of Esau, who is Edom.

036:002 Esau took his wives of the daughters of Canaan; Adah the
        daughter of Elon the Hittite, and Aholibamah the daughter of
        Anah the daughter of Zibeon the Hivite;

036:003 And Bashemath Ishmael's daughter, sister of Nebajoth.

036:004 And Adah bare to Esau Eliphaz; and Bashemath bare Reuel;

036:005 And Aholibamah bare Jeush, and Jaalam, and Korah: these are
        the sons of Esau, which were born unto him in the land of
        Canaan.

036:006 And Esau took his wives, and his sons, and his daughters, and
        all the persons of his house, and his cattle, and all his
        beasts, and all his substance, which he had got in the land of
        Canaan; and went into the country from the face of his brother
        Jacob.

036:007 For their riches were more than that they might dwell
        together; and the land wherein they were strangers could not
        bear them because of their cattle.

036:008 Thus dwelt Esau in mount Seir: Esau is Edom.

036:009 And these are the generations of Esau the father of the
        Edomites in mount Seir:

036:010 These are the names of Esau's sons; Eliphaz the son of Adah
        the wife of Esau, Reuel the son of Bashemath the wife of Esau.

036:011 And the sons of Eliphaz were Teman, Omar, Zepho, and Gatam,
        and Kenaz.

036:012 And Timna was concubine to Eliphaz Esau's son; and she bare to
        Eliphaz Amalek: these were the sons of Adah Esau's wife.

036:013 And these are the sons of Reuel; Nahath, and Zerah, Shammah,
        and Mizzah: these were the sons of Bashemath Esau's wife.

036:014 And these were the sons of Aholibamah, the daughter of Anah
        the daughter of Zibeon, Esau's wife: and she bare to Esau
        Jeush, and Jaalam, and Korah.

036:015 These were dukes of the sons of Esau: the sons of Eliphaz the
        firstborn son of Esau; duke Teman, duke Omar, duke Zepho, duke
        Kenaz,

036:016 Duke Korah, duke Gatam, and duke Amalek: these are the dukes
        that came of Eliphaz in the land of Edom; these were the sons
        of Adah.

036:017 And these are the sons of Reuel Esau's son; duke Nahath, duke
        Zerah, duke Shammah, duke Mizzah: these are the dukes that
        came of Reuel in the land of Edom; these are the sons of
        Bashemath Esau's wife.

036:018 And these are the sons of Aholibamah Esau's wife; duke Jeush,
        duke Jaalam, duke Korah: these were the dukes that came of
        Aholibamah the daughter of Anah, Esau's wife.

036:019 These are the sons of Esau, who is Edom, and these are their
        dukes.

036:020 These are the sons of Seir the Horite, who inhabited the land;
        Lotan, and Shobal, and Zibeon, and Anah,

036:021 And Dishon, and Ezer, and Dishan: these are the dukes of the
        Horites, the children of Seir in the land of Edom.

036:022 And the children of Lotan were Hori and Hemam; and Lotan's
        sister was Timna.

036:023 And the children of Shobal were these; Alvan, and Manahath,
        and Ebal, Shepho, and Onam.

036:024 And these are the children of Zibeon; both Ajah, and Anah:
        this was that Anah that found the mules in the wilderness, as
        he fed the asses of Zibeon his father.

036:025 And the children of Anah were these; Dishon, and Aholibamah
        the daughter of Anah.

036:026 And these are the children of Dishon; Hemdan, and Eshban, and
        Ithran, and Cheran.

036:027 The children of Ezer are these; Bilhan, and Zaavan, and Akan.

036:028 The children of Dishan are these; Uz, and Aran.

036:029 These are the dukes that came of the Horites; duke Lotan, duke
        Shobal, duke Zibeon, duke Anah,

036:030 Duke Dishon, duke Ezer, duke Dishan: these are the dukes that
        came of Hori, among their dukes in the land of Seir.

036:031 And these are the kings that reigned in the land of Edom,
        before there reigned any king over the children of Israel.

036:032 And Bela the son of Beor reigned in Edom: and the name of his
        city was Dinhabah.

036:033 And Bela died, and Jobab the son of Zerah of Bozrah reigned in
        his stead.

036:034 And Jobab died, and Husham of the land of Temani reigned in
        his stead.

036:035 And Husham died, and Hadad the son of Bedad, who smote Midian
        in the field of Moab, reigned in his stead: and the name of
        his city was Avith.

036:036 And Hadad died, and Samlah of Masrekah reigned in his stead.

036:037 And Samlah died, and Saul of Rehoboth by the river reigned in
        his stead.

036:038 And Saul died, and Baalhanan the son of Achbor reigned in his
        stead.

036:039 And Baalhanan the son of Achbor died, and Hadar reigned in his
        stead: and the name of his city was Pau; and his wife's name
        was Mehetabel, the daughter of Matred, the daughter of
        Mezahab.

036:040 And these are the names of the dukes that came of Esau,
        according to their families, after their places, by their
        names; duke Timnah, duke Alvah, duke Jetheth,

036:041 Duke Aholibamah, duke Elah, duke Pinon,

036:042 Duke Kenaz, duke Teman, duke Mibzar,

036:043 Duke Magdiel, duke Iram: these be the dukes of Edom, according
        to their habitations in the land of their possession: he is
        Esau the father of the Edomites.

037:001 And Jacob dwelt in the land wherein his father was a stranger,
        in the land of Canaan.

037:002 These are the generations of Jacob. Joseph, being seventeen
        years old, was feeding the flock with his brethren; and the
        lad was with the sons of Bilhah, and with the sons of Zilpah,
        his father's wives: and Joseph brought unto his father their
        evil report.

037:003 Now Israel loved Joseph more than all his children, because he
        was the son of his old age: and he made him a coat of many
        colours.

037:004 And when his brethren saw that their father loved him more
        than all his brethren, they hated him, and could not speak
        peaceably unto him.

037:005 And Joseph dreamed a dream, and he told it his brethren: and
        they hated him yet the more.

037:006 And he said unto them, Hear, I pray you, this dream which I
        have dreamed:

037:007 For, behold, we were binding sheaves in the field, and, lo, my
        sheaf arose, and also stood upright; and, behold, your sheaves
        stood round about, and made obeisance to my sheaf.

037:008 And his brethren said to him, Shalt thou indeed reign over us?
        or shalt thou indeed have dominion over us? And they hated him
        yet the more for his dreams, and for his words.

037:009 And he dreamed yet another dream, and told it his brethren,
        and said, Behold, I have dreamed a dream more; and, behold,
        the sun and the moon and the eleven stars made obeisance to
        me.

037:010 And he told it to his father, and to his brethren: and his
        father rebuked him, and said unto him, What is this dream that
        thou hast dreamed? Shall I and thy mother and thy brethren
        indeed come to bow down ourselves to thee to the earth?

037:011 And his brethren envied him; but his father observed the
        saying.

037:012 And his brethren went to feed their father's flock in Shechem.

037:013 And Israel said unto Joseph, Do not thy brethren feed the
        flock in Shechem? come, and I will send thee unto them. And he
        said to him, Here am I.

037:014 And he said to him, Go, I pray thee, see whether it be well
        with thy brethren, and well with the flocks; and bring me word
        again. So he sent him out of the vale of Hebron, and he came
        to Shechem.

037:015 And a certain man found him, and, behold, he was wandering in
        the field: and the man asked him, saying, What seekest thou?

037:016 And he said, I seek my brethren: tell me, I pray thee, where
        they feed their flocks.

037:017 And the man said, They are departed hence; for I heard them
        say, Let us go to Dothan. And Joseph went after his brethren,
        and found them in Dothan.

037:018 And when they saw him afar off, even before he came near unto
        them, they conspired against him to slay him.

037:019 And they said one to another, Behold, this dreamer cometh.

037:020 Come now therefore, and let us slay him, and cast him into
        some pit, and we will say, Some evil beast hath devoured him:
        and we shall see what will become of his dreams.

037:021 And Reuben heard it, and he delivered him out of their hands;
        and said, Let us not kill him.

037:022 And Reuben said unto them, Shed no blood, but cast him into
        this pit that is in the wilderness, and lay no hand upon him;
        that he might rid him out of their hands, to deliver him to
        his father again.

037:023 And it came to pass, when Joseph was come unto his brethren,
        that they stript Joseph out of his coat, his coat of many
        colours that was on him;

037:024 And they took him, and cast him into a pit: and the pit was
        empty, there was no water in it.

037:025 And they sat down to eat bread: and they lifted up their eyes
        and looked, and, behold, a company of Ishmeelites came from
        Gilead with their camels bearing spicery and balm and myrrh,
        going to carry it down to Egypt.

037:026 And Judah said unto his brethren, What profit is it if we slay
        our brother, and conceal his blood?

037:027 Come, and let us sell him to the Ishmeelites, and let not our
        hand be upon him; for he is our brother and our flesh. And his
        brethren were content.

037:028 Then there passed by Midianites merchantmen; and they drew and
        lifted up Joseph out of the pit, and sold Joseph to the
        Ishmeelites for twenty pieces of silver: and they brought
        Joseph into Egypt.

037:029 And Reuben returned unto the pit; and, behold, Joseph was not
        in the pit; and he rent his clothes.

037:030 And he returned unto his brethren, and said, The child is not;
        and I, whither shall I go?

037:031 And they took Joseph's coat, and killed a kid of the goats,
        and dipped the coat in the blood;

037:032 And they sent the coat of many colours, and they brought it to
        their father; and said, This have we found: know now whether
        it be thy son's coat or no.

037:033 And he knew it, and said, It is my son's coat; an evil beast
        hath devoured him; Joseph is without doubt rent in pieces.

037:034 And Jacob rent his clothes, and put sackcloth upon his loins,
        and mourned for his son many days.

037:035 And all his sons and all his daughters rose up to comfort him;
        but he refused to be comforted; and he said, For I will go
        down into the grave unto my son mourning. Thus his father wept
        for him.

037:036 And the Midianites sold him into Egypt unto Potiphar, an
        officer of Pharaoh's, and captain of the guard.

038:001 And it came to pass at that time, that Judah went down from
        his brethren, and turned in to a certain Adullamite, whose
        name was Hirah.

038:002 And Judah saw there a daughter of a certain Canaanite, whose
        name was Shuah; and he took her, and went in unto her.

038:003 And she conceived, and bare a son; and he called his name Er.

038:004 And she conceived again, and bare a son; and she called his
        name Onan.

038:005 And she yet again conceived, and bare a son; and called his
        name Shelah: and he was at Chezib, when she bare him.

038:006 And Judah took a wife for Er his firstborn, whose name was
        Tamar.

038:007 And Er, Judah's firstborn, was wicked in the sight of the
        LORD; and the LORD slew him.

038:008 And Judah said unto Onan, Go in unto thy brother's wife, and
        marry her, and raise up seed to thy brother.

038:009 And Onan knew that the seed should not be his; and it came to
        pass, when he went in unto his brother's wife, that he spilled
        it on the ground, lest that he should give seed to his
        brother.

038:010 And the thing which he did displeased the LORD: wherefore he
        slew him also.

038:011 Then said Judah to Tamar his daughter in law, Remain a widow
        at thy father's house, till Shelah my son be grown: for he
        said, Lest peradventure he die also, as his brethren did. And
        Tamar went and dwelt in her father's house.

038:012 And in process of time the daughter of Shuah Judah's wife
        died; and Judah was comforted, and went up unto his
        sheepshearers to Timnath, he and his friend Hirah the
        Adullamite.

038:013 And it was told Tamar, saying, Behold thy father in law goeth
        up to Timnath to shear his sheep.

038:014 And she put her widow's garments off from her, and covered her
        with a vail, and wrapped herself, and sat in an open place,
        which is by the way to Timnath; for she saw that Shelah was
        grown, and she was not given unto him to wife.

038:015 When Judah saw her, he thought her to be an harlot; because
        she had covered her face.

038:016 And he turned unto her by the way, and said, Go to, I pray
        thee, let me come in unto thee; (for he knew not that she was
        his daughter in law.) And she said, What wilt thou give me,
        that thou mayest come in unto me?

038:017 And he said, I will send thee a kid from the flock. And she
        said, Wilt thou give me a pledge, till thou send it?

038:018 And he said, What pledge shall I give thee? And she said, Thy
        signet, and thy bracelets, and thy staff that is in thine
        hand. And he gave it her, and came in unto her, and she
        conceived by him.

038:019 And she arose, and went away, and laid by her vail from her,
        and put on the garments of her widowhood.

038:020 And Judah sent the kid by the hand of his friend the
        Adullamite, to receive his pledge from the woman's hand: but
        he found her not.

038:021 Then he asked the men of that place, saying, Where is the
        harlot, that was openly by the way side? And they said, There
        was no harlot in this place.

038:022 And he returned to Judah, and said, I cannot find her; and
        also the men of the place said, that there was no harlot in
        this place.

038:023 And Judah said, Let her take it to her, lest we be shamed:
        behold, I sent this kid, and thou hast not found her.

038:024 And it came to pass about three months after, that it was told
        Judah, saying, Tamar thy daughter in law hath played the
        harlot; and also, behold, she is with child by whoredom. And
        Judah said, Bring her forth, and let her be burnt.

038:025 When she was brought forth, she sent to her father in law,
        saying, By the man, whose these are, am I with child: and she
        said, Discern, I pray thee, whose are these, the signet, and
        bracelets, and staff.

038:026 And Judah acknowledged them, and said, She hath been more
        righteous than I; because that I gave her not to Shelah my
        son. And he knew her again no more.

038:027 And it came to pass in the time of her travail, that, behold,
        twins were in her womb.

038:028 And it came to pass, when she travailed, that the one put out
        his hand: and the midwife took and bound upon his hand a
        scarlet thread, saying, This came out first.

038:029 And it came to pass, as he drew back his hand, that, behold,
        his brother came out: and she said, How hast thou broken
        forth? this breach be upon thee: therefore his name was called
        Pharez.

038:030 And afterward came out his brother, that had the scarlet
        thread upon his hand: and his name was called Zarah.

039:001 And Joseph was brought down to Egypt; and Potiphar, an officer
        of Pharaoh, captain of the guard, an Egyptian, bought him of
        the hands of the Ishmeelites, which had brought him down
        thither.

039:002 And the LORD was with Joseph, and he was a prosperous man; and
        he was in the house of his master the Egyptian.

039:003 And his master saw that the LORD was with him, and that the
        LORD made all that he did to prosper in his hand.

039:004 And Joseph found grace in his sight, and he served him: and he
        made him overseer over his house, and all that he had he put
        into his hand.

039:005 And it came to pass from the time that he had made him
        overseer in his house, and over all that he had, that the LORD
        blessed the Egyptian's house for Joseph's sake; and the
        blessing of the LORD was upon all that he had in the house,
        and in the field.

039:006 And he left all that he had in Joseph's hand; and he knew not
        ought he had, save the bread which he did eat. And Joseph was
        a goodly person, and well favoured.

039:007 And it came to pass after these things, that his master's wife
        cast her eyes upon Joseph; and she said, Lie with me.

039:008 But he refused, and said unto his master's wife, Behold, my
        master wotteth not what is with me in the house, and he hath
        committed all that he hath to my hand;

039:009 There is none greater in this house than I; neither hath he
        kept back any thing from me but thee, because thou art his
        wife: how then can I do this great wickedness, and sin against
        God?

039:010 And it came to pass, as she spake to Joseph day by day, that
        he hearkened not unto her, to lie by her, or to be with her.

039:011 And it came to pass about this time, that Joseph went into the
        house to do his business; and there was none of the men of the
        house there within.

039:012 And she caught him by his garment, saying, Lie with me: and he
        left his garment in her hand, and fled, and got him out.

039:013 And it came to pass, when she saw that he had left his garment
        in her hand, and was fled forth,

039:014 That she called unto the men of her house, and spake unto
        them, saying, See, he hath brought in an Hebrew unto us to
        mock us; he came in unto me to lie with me, and I cried with a
        loud voice:

039:015 And it came to pass, when he heard that I lifted up my voice
        and cried, that he left his garment with me, and fled, and got
        him out.

039:016 And she laid up his garment by her, until his lord came home.

039:017 And she spake unto him according to these words, saying, The
        Hebrew servant, which thou hast brought unto us, came in unto
        me to mock me:

039:018 And it came to pass, as I lifted up my voice and cried, that
        he left his garment with me, and fled out.

039:019 And it came to pass, when his master heard the words of his
        wife, which she spake unto him, saying, After this manner did
        thy servant to me; that his wrath was kindled.

039:020 And Joseph's master took him, and put him into the prison, a
        place where the king's prisoners were bound: and he was there
        in the prison.

039:021 But the LORD was with Joseph, and shewed him mercy, and gave
        him favour in the sight of the keeper of the prison.

039:022 And the keeper of the prison committed to Joseph's hand all
        the prisoners that were in the prison; and whatsoever they did
        there, he was the doer of it.

039:023 The keeper of the prison looked not to any thing that was
        under his hand; because the LORD was with him, and that which
        he did, the LORD made it to prosper.

040:001 And it came to pass after these things, that the butler of the
        king of Egypt and his baker had offended their lord the king
        of Egypt.

040:002 And Pharaoh was wroth against two of his officers, against the
        chief of the butlers, and against the chief of the bakers.

040:003 And he put them in ward in the house of the captain of the
        guard, into the prison, the place where Joseph was bound.

040:004 And the captain of the guard charged Joseph with them, and he
        served them: and they continued a season in ward.

040:005 And they dreamed a dream both of them, each man his dream in
        one night, each man according to the interpretation of his
        dream, the butler and the baker of the king of Egypt, which
        were bound in the prison.

040:006 And Joseph came in unto them in the morning, and looked upon
        them, and, behold, they were sad.

040:007 And he asked Pharaoh's officers that were with him in the ward
        of his lord's house, saying, Wherefore look ye so sadly to
        day?

040:008 And they said unto him, We have dreamed a dream, and there is
        no interpreter of it. And Joseph said unto them, Do not
        interpretations belong to God? tell me them, I pray you.

040:009 And the chief butler told his dream to Joseph, and said to
        him, In my dream, behold, a vine was before me;

040:010 And in the vine were three branches: and it was as though it
        budded, and her blossoms shot forth; and the clusters thereof
        brought forth ripe grapes:

040:011 And Pharaoh's cup was in my hand: and I took the grapes, and
        pressed them into Pharaoh's cup, and I gave the cup into
        Pharaoh's hand.

040:012 And Joseph said unto him, This is the interpretation of it:
        The three branches are three days:

040:013 Yet within three days shall Pharaoh lift up thine head, and
        restore thee unto thy place: and thou shalt deliver Pharaoh's
        cup into his hand, after the former manner when thou wast his
        butler.

040:014 But think on me when it shall be well with thee, and shew
        kindness, I pray thee, unto me, and make mention of me unto
        Pharaoh, and bring me out of this house:

040:015 For indeed I was stolen away out of the land of the Hebrews:
        and here also have I done nothing that they should put me into
        the dungeon.

040:016 When the chief baker saw that the interpretation was good, he
        said unto Joseph, I also was in my dream, and, behold, I had
        three white baskets on my head:

040:017 And in the uppermost basket there was of all manner of
        bakemeats for Pharaoh; and the birds did eat them out of the
        basket upon my head.

040:018 And Joseph answered and said, This is the interpretation
        thereof: The three baskets are three days:

040:019 Yet within three days shall Pharaoh lift up thy head from off
        thee, and shall hang thee on a tree; and the birds shall eat
        thy flesh from off thee.

040:020 And it came to pass the third day, which was Pharaoh's
        birthday, that he made a feast unto all his servants: and he
        lifted up the head of the chief butler and of the chief baker
        among his servants.

040:021 And he restored the chief butler unto his butlership again;
        and he gave the cup into Pharaoh's hand:

040:022 But he hanged the chief baker: as Joseph had interpreted to
        them.

040:023 Yet did not the chief butler remember Joseph, but forgat him.

041:001 And it came to pass at the end of two full years, that Pharaoh
        dreamed: and, behold, he stood by the river.

041:002 And, behold, there came up out of the river seven well
        favoured kine and fatfleshed; and they fed in a meadow.

041:003 And, behold, seven other kine came up after them out of the
        river, ill favoured and leanfleshed; and stood by the other
        kine upon the brink of the river.

041:004 And the ill favoured and leanfleshed kine did eat up the seven
        well favoured and fat kine. So Pharaoh awoke.

041:005 And he slept and dreamed the second time: and, behold, seven
        ears of corn came up upon one stalk, rank and good.

041:006 And, behold, seven thin ears and blasted with the east wind
        sprung up after them.

041:007 And the seven thin ears devoured the seven rank and full ears.
        And Pharaoh awoke, and, behold, it was a dream.

041:008 And it came to pass in the morning that his spirit was
        troubled; and he sent and called for all the magicians of
        Egypt, and all the wise men thereof: and Pharaoh told them his
        dream; but there was none that could interpret them unto
        Pharaoh.

041:009 Then spake the chief butler unto Pharaoh, saying, I do
        remember my faults this day:

041:010 Pharaoh was wroth with his servants, and put me in ward in the
        captain of the guard's house, both me and the chief baker:

041:011 And we dreamed a dream in one night, I and he; we dreamed each
        man according to the interpretation of his dream.

041:012 And there was there with us a young man, an Hebrew, servant to
        the captain of the guard; and we told him, and he interpreted
        to us our dreams; to each man according to his dream he did
        interpret.

041:013 And it came to pass, as he interpreted to us, so it was; me he
        restored unto mine office, and him he hanged.

041:014 Then Pharaoh sent and called Joseph, and they brought him
        hastily out of the dungeon: and he shaved himself, and changed
        his raiment, and came in unto Pharaoh.

041:015 And Pharaoh said unto Joseph, I have dreamed a dream, and
        there is none that can interpret it: and I have heard say of
        thee, that thou canst understand a dream to interpret it.

041:016 And Joseph answered Pharaoh, saying, It is not in me: God
        shall give Pharaoh an answer of peace.

041:017 And Pharaoh said unto Joseph, In my dream, behold, I stood
        upon the bank of the river:

041:018 And, behold, there came up out of the river seven kine,
        fatfleshed and well favoured; and they fed in a meadow:

041:019 And, behold, seven other kine came up after them, poor and
        very ill favoured and leanfleshed, such as I never saw in all
        the land of Egypt for badness:

041:020 And the lean and the ill favoured kine did eat up the first
        seven fat kine:

041:021 And when they had eaten them up, it could not be known that
        they had eaten them; but they were still ill favoured, as at
        the beginning. So I awoke.

041:022 And I saw in my dream, and, behold, seven ears came up in one
        stalk, full and good:

041:023 And, behold, seven ears, withered, thin, and blasted with the
        east wind, sprung up after them:

041:024 And the thin ears devoured the seven good ears: and I told
        this unto the magicians; but there was none that could declare
        it to me.

041:025 And Joseph said unto Pharaoh, The dream of Pharaoh is one: God
        hath shewed Pharaoh what he is about to do.

041:026 The seven good kine are seven years; and the seven good ears
        are seven years: the dream is one.

041:027 And the seven thin and ill favoured kine that came up after
        them are seven years; and the seven empty ears blasted with
        the east wind shall be seven years of famine.

041:028 This is the thing which I have spoken unto Pharaoh: What God
        is about to do he sheweth unto Pharaoh.

041:029 Behold, there come seven years of great plenty throughout all
        the land of Egypt:

041:030 And there shall arise after them seven years of famine; and
        all the plenty shall be forgotten in the land of Egypt; and
        the famine shall consume the land;

041:031 And the plenty shall not be known in the land by reason of
        that famine following; for it shall be very grievous.

041:032 And for that the dream was doubled unto Pharaoh twice; it is
        because the thing is established by God, and God will shortly
        bring it to pass.

041:033 Now therefore let Pharaoh look out a man discreet and wise,
        and set him over the land of Egypt.

041:034 Let Pharaoh do this, and let him appoint officers over the
        land, and take up the fifth part of the land of Egypt in the
        seven plenteous years.

041:035 And let them gather all the food of those good years that
        come, and lay up corn under the hand of Pharaoh, and let them
        keep food in the cities.

041:036 And that food shall be for store to the land against the seven
        years of famine, which shall be in the land of Egypt; that the
        land perish not through the famine.

041:037 And the thing was good in the eyes of Pharaoh, and in the eyes
        of all his servants.

041:038 And Pharaoh said unto his servants, Can we find such a one as
        this is, a man in whom the Spirit of God is?

041:039 And Pharaoh said unto Joseph, Forasmuch as God hath shewed
        thee all this, there is none so discreet and wise as thou art:

041:040 Thou shalt be over my house, and according unto thy word shall
        all my people be ruled: only in the throne will I be greater
        than thou.

041:041 And Pharaoh said unto Joseph, See, I have set thee over all
        the land of Egypt.

041:042 And Pharaoh took off his ring from his hand, and put it upon
        Joseph's hand, and arrayed him in vestures of fine linen, and
        put a gold chain about his neck;

041:043 And he made him to ride in the second chariot which he had;
        and they cried before him, Bow the knee: and he made him ruler
        over all the land of Egypt.

041:044 And Pharaoh said unto Joseph, I am Pharaoh, and without thee
        shall no man lift up his hand or foot in all the land of
        Egypt.

041:045 And Pharaoh called Joseph's name Zaphnathpaaneah; and he gave
        him to wife Asenath the daughter of Potipherah priest of On.
        And Joseph went out over all the land of Egypt.

041:046 And Joseph was thirty years old when he stood before Pharaoh
        king of Egypt. And Joseph went out from the presence of
        Pharaoh, and went throughout all the land of Egypt.

041:047 And in the seven plenteous years the earth brought forth by
        handfuls.

041:048 And he gathered up all the food of the seven years, which were
        in the land of Egypt, and laid up the food in the cities: the
        food of the field, which was round about every city, laid he
        up in the same.

041:049 And Joseph gathered corn as the sand of the sea, very much,
        until he left numbering; for it was without number.

041:050 And unto Joseph were born two sons before the years of famine
        came, which Asenath the daughter of Potipherah priest of On
        bare unto him.

041:051 And Joseph called the name of the firstborn Manasseh: For God,
        said he, hath made me forget all my toil, and all my father's
        house.

041:052 And the name of the second called he Ephraim: For God hath
        caused me to be fruitful in the land of my affliction.

041:053 And the seven years of plenteousness, that was in the land of
        Egypt, were ended.

041:054 And the seven years of dearth began to come, according as
        Joseph had said: and the dearth was in all lands; but in all
        the land of Egypt there was bread.

041:055 And when all the land of Egypt was famished, the people cried
        to Pharaoh for bread: and Pharaoh said unto all the Egyptians,
        Go unto Joseph; what he saith to you, do.

041:056 And the famine was over all the face of the earth: and Joseph
        opened all the storehouses, and sold unto the Egyptians; and
        the famine waxed sore in the land of Egypt.

041:057 And all countries came into Egypt to Joseph for to buy corn;
        because that the famine was so sore in all lands.

042:001 Now when Jacob saw that there was corn in Egypt, Jacob said
        unto his sons, Why do ye look one upon another?

042:002 And he said, Behold, I have heard that there is corn in Egypt:
        get you down thither, and buy for us from thence; that we may
        live, and not die.

042:003 And Joseph's ten brethren went down to buy corn in Egypt.

042:004 But Benjamin, Joseph's brother, Jacob sent not with his
        brethren; for he said, Lest peradventure mischief befall him.

042:005 And the sons of Israel came to buy corn among those that came:
        for the famine was in the land of Canaan.

042:006 And Joseph was the governor over the land, and he it was that
        sold to all the people of the land: and Joseph's brethren
        came, and bowed down themselves before him with their faces to
        the earth.

042:007 And Joseph saw his brethren, and he knew them, but made
        himself strange unto them, and spake roughly unto them; and he
        said unto them, Whence come ye? And they said, From the land
        of Canaan to buy food.

042:008 And Joseph knew his brethren, but they knew not him.

042:009 And Joseph remembered the dreams which he dreamed of them, and
        said unto them, Ye are spies; to see the nakedness of the land
        ye are come.

042:010 And they said unto him, Nay, my lord, but to buy food are thy
        servants come.

042:011 We are all one man's sons; we are true men, thy servants are
        no spies.

042:012 And he said unto them, Nay, but to see the nakedness of the
        land ye are come.

042:013 And they said, Thy servants are twelve brethren, the sons of
        one man in the land of Canaan; and, behold, the youngest is
        this day with our father, and one is not.

042:014 And Joseph said unto them, That is it that I spake unto you,
        saying, Ye are spies:

042:015 Hereby ye shall be proved: By the life of Pharaoh ye shall not
        go forth hence, except your youngest brother come hither.

042:016 Send one of you, and let him fetch your brother, and ye shall
        be kept in prison, that your words may be proved, whether
        there be any truth in you: or else by the life of Pharaoh
        surely ye are spies.

042:017 And he put them all together into ward three days.

042:018 And Joseph said unto them the third day, This do, and live;
        for I fear God:

042:019 If ye be true men, let one of your brethren be bound in the
        house of your prison: go ye, carry corn for the famine of your
        houses:

042:020 But bring your youngest brother unto me; so shall your words
        be verified, and ye shall not die. And they did so.

042:021 And they said one to another, We are verily guilty concerning
        our brother, in that we saw the anguish of his soul, when he
        besought us, and we would not hear; therefore is this distress
        come upon us.

042:022 And Reuben answered them, saying, Spake I not unto you,
        saying, Do not sin against the child; and ye would not hear?
        therefore, behold, also his blood is required.

042:023 And they knew not that Joseph understood them; for he spake
        unto them by an interpreter.

042:024 And he turned himself about from them, and wept; and returned
        to them again, and communed with them, and took from them
        Simeon, and bound him before their eyes.

042:025 Then Joseph commanded to fill their sacks with corn, and to
        restore every man's money into his sack, and to give them
        provision for the way: and thus did he unto them.

042:026 And they laded their asses with the corn, and departed thence.

042:027 And as one of them opened his sack to give his ass provender
        in the inn, he espied his money; for, behold, it was in his
        sack's mouth.

042:028 And he said unto his brethren, My money is restored; and, lo,
        it is even in my sack: and their heart failed them, and they
        were afraid, saying one to another, What is this that God hath
        done unto us?

042:029 And they came unto Jacob their father unto the land of Canaan,
        and told him all that befell unto them; saying,

042:030 The man, who is the lord of the land, spake roughly to us, and
        took us for spies of the country.

042:031 And we said unto him, We are true men; we are no spies:

042:032 We be twelve brethren, sons of our father; one is not, and the
        youngest is this day with our father in the land of Canaan.

042:033 And the man, the lord of the country, said unto us, Hereby
        shall I know that ye are true men; leave one of your brethren
        here with me, and take food for the famine of your households,
        and be gone:

042:034 And bring your youngest brother unto me: then shall I know
        that ye are no spies, but that ye are true men: so will I
        deliver you your brother, and ye shall traffick in the land.

042:035 And it came to pass as they emptied their sacks, that, behold,
        every man's bundle of money was in his sack: and when both
        they and their father saw the bundles of money, they were
        afraid.

042:036 And Jacob their father said unto them, Me have ye bereaved of
        my children: Joseph is not, and Simeon is not, and ye will
        take Benjamin away: all these things are against me.

042:037 And Reuben spake unto his father, saying, Slay my two sons, if
        I bring him not to thee: deliver him into my hand, and I will
        bring him to thee again.

042:038 And he said, My son shall not go down with you; for his
        brother is dead, and he is left alone: if mischief befall him
        by the way in the which ye go, then shall ye bring down my
        gray hairs with sorrow to the grave.

043:001 And the famine was sore in the land.

043:002 And it came to pass, when they had eaten up the corn which
        they had brought out of Egypt, their father said unto them, Go
        again, buy us a little food.

043:003 And Judah spake unto him, saying, The man did solemnly protest
        unto us, saying, Ye shall not see my face, except your brother
        be with you.

043:004 If thou wilt send our brother with us, we will go down and buy
        thee food:

043:005 But if thou wilt not send him, we will not go down: for the
        man said unto us, Ye shall not see my face, except your
        brother be with you.

043:006 And Israel said, Wherefore dealt ye so ill with me, as to tell
        the man whether ye had yet a brother?

043:007 And they said, The man asked us straitly of our state, and of
        our kindred, saying, Is your father yet alive? have ye another
        brother? and we told him according to the tenor of these
        words: could we certainly know that he would say, Bring your
        brother down?

043:008 And Judah said unto Israel his father, Send the lad with me,
        and we will arise and go; that we may live, and not die, both
        we, and thou, and also our little ones.

043:009 I will be surety for him; of my hand shalt thou require him:
        if I bring him not unto thee, and set him before thee, then
        let me bear the blame for ever:

043:010 For except we had lingered, surely now we had returned this
        second time.

043:011 And their father Israel said unto them, If it must be so now,
        do this; take of the best fruits in the land in your vessels,
        and carry down the man a present, a little balm, and a little
        honey, spices, and myrrh, nuts, and almonds:

043:012 And take double money in your hand; and the money that was
        brought again in the mouth of your sacks, carry it again in
        your hand; peradventure it was an oversight:

043:013 Take also your brother, and arise, go again unto the man:

043:014 And God Almighty give you mercy before the man, that he may
        send away your other brother, and Benjamin. If I be bereaved
        of my children, I am bereaved.

043:015 And the men took that present, and they took double money in
        their hand and Benjamin; and rose up, and went down to Egypt,
        and stood before Joseph.

043:016 And when Joseph saw Benjamin with them, he said to the ruler
        of his house, Bring these men home, and slay, and make ready;
        for these men shall dine with me at noon.

043:017 And the man did as Joseph bade; and the man brought the men
        into Joseph's house.

043:018 And the men were afraid, because they were brought into
        Joseph's house; and they said, Because of the money that was
        returned in our sacks at the first time are we brought in;
        that he may seek occasion against us, and fall upon us, and
        take us for bondmen, and our asses.

043:019 And they came near to the steward of Joseph's house, and they
        communed with him at the door of the house,

043:020 And said, O sir, we came indeed down at the first time to buy
        food:

043:021 And it came to pass, when we came to the inn, that we opened
        our sacks, and, behold, every man's money was in the mouth of
        his sack, our money in full weight: and we have brought it
        again in our hand.

043:022 And other money have we brought down in our hands to buy food:
        we cannot tell who put our money in our sacks.

043:023 And he said, Peace be to you, fear not: your God, and the God
        of your father, hath given you treasure in your sacks: I had
        your money. And he brought Simeon out unto them.

043:024 And the man brought the men into Joseph's house, and gave them
        water, and they washed their feet; and he gave their asses
        provender.

043:025 And they made ready the present against Joseph came at noon:
        for they heard that they should eat bread there.

043:026 And when Joseph came home, they brought him the present which
        was in their hand into the house, and bowed themselves to him
        to the earth.

043:027 And he asked them of their welfare, and said, Is your father
        well, the old man of whom ye spake? Is he yet alive?

043:028 And they answered, Thy servant our father is in good health,
        he is yet alive. And they bowed down their heads, and made
        obeisance.

043:029 And he lifted up his eyes, and saw his brother Benjamin, his
        mother's son, and said, Is this your younger brother, of whom
        ye spake unto me? And he said, God be gracious unto thee, my
        son.

043:030 And Joseph made haste; for his bowels did yearn upon his
        brother: and he sought where to weep; and he entered into his
        chamber, and wept there.

043:031 And he washed his face, and went out, and refrained himself,
        and said, Set on bread.

043:032 And they set on for him by himself, and for them by
        themselves, and for the Egyptians, which did eat with him, by
        themselves: because the Egyptians might not eat bread with the
        Hebrews; for that is an abomination unto the Egyptians.

043:033 And they sat before him, the firstborn according to his
        birthright, and the youngest according to his youth: and the
        men marvelled one at another.

043:034 And he took and sent messes unto them from before him: but
        Benjamin's mess was five times so much as any of their's. And
        they drank, and were merry with him.

044:001 And he commanded the steward of his house, saying, Fill the
        men's sacks with food, as much as they can carry, and put
        every man's money in his sack's mouth.

044:002 And put my cup, the silver cup, in the sack's mouth of the
        youngest, and his corn money. And he did according to the word
        that Joseph had spoken.

044:003 As soon as the morning was light, the men were sent away, they
        and their asses.

044:004 And when they were gone out of the city, and not yet far off,
        Joseph said unto his steward, Up, follow after the men; and
        when thou dost overtake them, say unto them, Wherefore have ye
        rewarded evil for good?

044:005 Is not this it in which my lord drinketh, and whereby indeed
        he divineth? ye have done evil in so doing.

044:006 And he overtook them, and he spake unto them these same words.

044:007 And they said unto him, Wherefore saith my lord these words?
        God forbid that thy servants should do according to this
        thing:

044:008 Behold, the money, which we found in our sacks' mouths, we
        brought again unto thee out of the land of Canaan: how then
        should we steal out of thy lord's house silver or gold?

044:009 With whomsoever of thy servants it be found, both let him die,
        and we also will be my lord's bondmen.

044:010 And he said, Now also let it be according unto your words: he
        with whom it is found shall be my servant; and ye shall be
        blameless.

044:011 Then they speedily took down every man his sack to the ground,
        and opened every man his sack.

044:012 And he searched, and began at the eldest, and left at the
        youngest: and the cup was found in Benjamin's sack.

044:013 Then they rent their clothes, and laded every man his ass, and
        returned to the city.

044:014 And Judah and his brethren came to Joseph's house; for he was
        yet there: and they fell before him on the ground.

044:015 And Joseph said unto them, What deed is this that ye have
        done? wot ye not that such a man as I can certainly divine?

044:016 And Judah said, What shall we say unto my lord? what shall we
        speak? or how shall we clear ourselves? God hath found out the
        iniquity of thy servants: behold, we are my lord's servants,
        both we, and he also with whom the cup is found.

044:017 And he said, God forbid that I should do so: but the man in
        whose hand the cup is found, he shall be my servant; and as
        for you, get you up in peace unto your father.

044:018 Then Judah came near unto him, and said, Oh my lord, let thy
        servant, I pray thee, speak a word in my lord's ears, and let
        not thine anger burn against thy servant: for thou art even as
        Pharaoh.

044:019 My lord asked his servants, saying, Have ye a father, or a
        brother?

044:020 And we said unto my lord, We have a father, an old man, and a
        child of his old age, a little one; and his brother is dead,
        and he alone is left of his mother, and his father loveth him.

044:021 And thou saidst unto thy servants, Bring him down unto me,
        that I may set mine eyes upon him.

044:022 And we said unto my lord, The lad cannot leave his father: for
        if he should leave his father, his father would die.

044:023 And thou saidst unto thy servants, Except your youngest
        brother come down with you, ye shall see my face no more.

044:024 And it came to pass when we came up unto thy servant my
        father, we told him the words of my lord.

044:025 And our father said, Go again, and buy us a little food.

044:026 And we said, We cannot go down: if our youngest brother be
        with us, then will we go down: for we may not see the man's
        face, except our youngest brother be with us.

044:027 And thy servant my father said unto us, Ye know that my wife
        bare me two sons:

044:028 And the one went out from me, and I said, Surely he is torn in
        pieces; and I saw him not since:

044:029 And if ye take this also from me, and mischief befall him, ye
        shall bring down my gray hairs with sorrow to the grave.

044:030 Now therefore when I come to thy servant my father, and the
        lad be not with us; seeing that his life is bound up in the
        lad's life;

044:031 It shall come to pass, when he seeth that the lad is not with
        us, that he will die: and thy servants shall bring down the
        gray hairs of thy servant our father with sorrow to the grave.

044:032 For thy servant became surety for the lad unto my father,
        saying, If I bring him not unto thee, then I shall bear the
        blame to my father for ever.

044:033 Now therefore, I pray thee, let thy servant abide instead of
        the lad a bondman to my lord; and let the lad go up with his
        brethren.

044:034 For how shall I go up to my father, and the lad be not with
        me? lest peradventure I see the evil that shall come on my
        father.

045:001 Then Joseph could not refrain himself before all them that
        stood by him; and he cried, Cause every man to go out from me.
        And there stood no man with him, while Joseph made himself
        known unto his brethren.

045:002 And he wept aloud: and the Egyptians and the house of Pharaoh
        heard.

045:003 And Joseph said unto his brethren, I am Joseph; doth my father
        yet live? And his brethren could not answer him; for they were
        troubled at his presence.

045:004 And Joseph said unto his brethren, Come near to me, I pray
        you. And they came near. And he said, I am Joseph your
        brother, whom ye sold into Egypt.

045:005 Now therefore be not grieved, nor angry with yourselves, that
        ye sold me hither: for God did send me before you to preserve
        life.

045:006 For these two years hath the famine been in the land: and yet
        there are five years, in the which there shall neither be
        earing nor harvest.

045:007 And God sent me before you to preserve you a posterity in the
        earth, and to save your lives by a great deliverance.

045:008 So now it was not you that sent me hither, but God: and he
        hath made me a father to Pharaoh, and lord of all his house,
        and a ruler throughout all the land of Egypt.

045:009 Haste ye, and go up to my father, and say unto him, Thus saith
        thy son Joseph, God hath made me lord of all Egypt: come down
        unto me, tarry not:

045:010 And thou shalt dwell in the land of Goshen, and thou shalt be
        near unto me, thou, and thy children, and thy children's
        children, and thy flocks, and thy herds, and all that thou
        hast:

045:011 And there will I nourish thee; for yet there are five years of
        famine; lest thou, and thy household, and all that thou hast,
        come to poverty.

045:012 And, behold, your eyes see, and the eyes of my brother
        Benjamin, that it is my mouth that speaketh unto you.

045:013 And ye shall tell my father of all my glory in Egypt, and of
        all that ye have seen; and ye shall haste and bring down my
        father hither.

045:014 And he fell upon his brother Benjamin's neck, and wept; and
        Benjamin wept upon his neck.

045:015 Moreover he kissed all his brethren, and wept upon them: and
        after that his brethren talked with him.

045:016 And the fame thereof was heard in Pharaoh's house, saying,
        Joseph's brethren are come: and it pleased Pharaoh well, and
        his servants.

045:017 And Pharaoh said unto Joseph, Say unto thy brethren, This do
        ye; lade your beasts, and go, get you unto the land of Canaan;

045:018 And take your father and your households, and come unto me:
        and I will give you the good of the land of Egypt, and ye
        shall eat the fat of the land.

045:019 Now thou art commanded, this do ye; take you wagons out of the
        land of Egypt for your little ones, and for your wives, and
        bring your father, and come.

045:020 Also regard not your stuff; for the good of all the land of
        Egypt is your's.

045:021 And the children of Israel did so: and Joseph gave them
        wagons, according to the commandment of Pharaoh, and gave them
        provision for the way.

045:022 To all of them he gave each man changes of raiment; but to
        Benjamin he gave three hundred pieces of silver, and five
        changes of raiment.

045:023 And to his father he sent after this manner; ten asses laden
        with the good things of Egypt, and ten she asses laden with
        corn and bread and meat for his father by the way.

045:024 So he sent his brethren away, and they departed: and he said
        unto them, See that ye fall not out by the way.

045:025 And they went up out of Egypt, and came into the land of
        Canaan unto Jacob their father,

045:026 And told him, saying, Joseph is yet alive, and he is governor
        over all the land of Egypt. And Jacob's heart fainted, for he
        believed them not.

045:027 And they told him all the words of Joseph, which he had said
        unto them: and when he saw the wagons which Joseph had sent to
        carry him, the spirit of Jacob their father revived:

045:028 And Israel said, It is enough; Joseph my son is yet alive: I
        will go and see him before I die.

046:001 And Israel took his journey with all that he had, and came to
        Beersheba, and offered sacrifices unto the God of his father
        Isaac.

046:002 And God spake unto Israel in the visions of the night, and
        said, Jacob, Jacob. And he said, Here am I.

046:003 And he said, I am God, the God of thy father: fear not to go
        down into Egypt; for I will there make of thee a great nation:

046:004 I will go down with thee into Egypt; and I will also surely
        bring thee up again: and Joseph shall put his hand upon thine
        eyes.

046:005 And Jacob rose up from Beersheba: and the sons of Israel
        carried Jacob their father, and their little ones, and their
        wives, in the wagons which Pharaoh had sent to carry him.

046:006 And they took their cattle, and their goods, which they had
        gotten in the land of Canaan, and came into Egypt, Jacob, and
        all his seed with him:

046:007 His sons, and his sons' sons with him, his daughters, and his
        sons' daughters, and all his seed brought he with him into
        Egypt.

046:008 And these are the names of the children of Israel, which came
        into Egypt, Jacob and his sons: Reuben, Jacob's firstborn.

046:009 And the sons of Reuben; Hanoch, and Phallu, and Hezron, and
        Carmi.

046:010 And the sons of Simeon; Jemuel, and Jamin, and Ohad, and
        Jachin, and Zohar, and Shaul the son of a Canaanitish woman.

046:011 And the sons of Levi; Gershon, Kohath, and Merari.

046:012 And the sons of Judah; Er, and Onan, and Shelah, and Pharez,
        and Zarah: but Er and Onan died in the land of Canaan. And the
        sons of Pharez were Hezron and Hamul.

046:013 And the sons of Issachar; Tola, and Phuvah, and Job, and
        Shimron.

046:014 And the sons of Zebulun; Sered, and Elon, and Jahleel.

046:015 These be the sons of Leah, which she bare unto Jacob in
        Padanaram, with his daughter Dinah: all the souls of his sons
        and his daughters were thirty and three.

046:016 And the sons of Gad; Ziphion, and Haggi, Shuni, and Ezbon,
        Eri, and Arodi, and Areli.

046:017 And the sons of Asher; Jimnah, and Ishuah, and Isui, and
        Beriah, and Serah their sister: and the sons of Beriah; Heber,
        and Malchiel.

046:018 These are the sons of Zilpah, whom Laban gave to Leah his
        daughter, and these she bare unto Jacob, even sixteen souls.

046:019 The sons of Rachel Jacob's wife; Joseph, and Benjamin.

046:020 And unto Joseph in the land of Egypt were born Manasseh and
        Ephraim, which Asenath the daughter of Potipherah priest of On
        bare unto him.

046:021 And the sons of Benjamin were Belah, and Becher, and Ashbel,
        Gera, and Naaman, Ehi, and Rosh, Muppim, and Huppim, and Ard.

046:022 These are the sons of Rachel, which were born to Jacob: all
        the souls were fourteen.

046:023 And the sons of Dan; Hushim.

046:024 And the sons of Naphtali; Jahzeel, and Guni, and Jezer, and
        Shillem.

046:025 These are the sons of Bilhah, which Laban gave unto Rachel his
        daughter, and she bare these unto Jacob: all the souls were
        seven.

046:026 All the souls that came with Jacob into Egypt, which came out
        of his loins, besides Jacob's sons' wives, all the souls were
        threescore and six;

046:027 And the sons of Joseph, which were born him in Egypt, were two
        souls: all the souls of the house of Jacob, which came into
        Egypt, were threescore and ten.

046:028 And he sent Judah before him unto Joseph, to direct his face
        unto Goshen; and they came into the land of Goshen.

046:029 And Joseph made ready his chariot, and went up to meet Israel
        his father, to Goshen, and presented himself unto him; and he
        fell on his neck, and wept on his neck a good while.

046:030 And Israel said unto Joseph, Now let me die, since I have seen
        thy face, because thou art yet alive.

046:031 And Joseph said unto his brethren, and unto his father's
        house, I will go up, and shew Pharaoh, and say unto him, My
        brethren, and my father's house, which were in the land of
        Canaan, are come unto me;

046:032 And the men are shepherds, for their trade hath been to feed
        cattle; and they have brought their flocks, and their herds,
        and all that they have.

046:033 And it shall come to pass, when Pharaoh shall call you, and
        shall say, What is your occupation?

046:034 That ye shall say, Thy servants' trade hath been about cattle
        from our youth even until now, both we, and also our fathers:
        that ye may dwell in the land of Goshen; for every shepherd is
        an abomination unto the Egyptians.

047:001 Then Joseph came and told Pharaoh, and said, My father and my
        brethren, and their flocks, and their herds, and all that they
        have, are come out of the land of Canaan; and, behold, they
        are in the land of Goshen.

047:002 And he took some of his brethren, even five men, and presented
        them unto Pharaoh.

047:003 And Pharaoh said unto his brethren, What is your occupation?
        And they said unto Pharaoh, Thy servants are shepherds, both
        we, and also our fathers.

047:004 They said morever unto Pharaoh, For to sojourn in the land are
        we come; for thy servants have no pasture for their flocks;
        for the famine is sore in the land of Canaan: now therefore,
        we pray thee, let thy servants dwell in the land of Goshen.

047:005 And Pharaoh spake unto Joseph, saying, Thy father and thy
        brethren are come unto thee:

047:006 The land of Egypt is before thee; in the best of the land make
        thy father and brethren to dwell; in the land of Goshen let
        them dwell: and if thou knowest any men of activity among
        them, then make them rulers over my cattle.

047:007 And Joseph brought in Jacob his father, and set him before
        Pharaoh: and Jacob blessed Pharaoh.

047:008 And Pharaoh said unto Jacob, How old art thou?

047:009 And Jacob said unto Pharaoh, The days of the years of my
        pilgrimage are an hundred and thirty years: few and evil have
        the days of the years of my life been, and have not attained
        unto the days of the years of the life of my fathers in the
        days of their pilgrimage.

047:010 And Jacob blessed Pharaoh, and went out from before Pharaoh.

047:011 And Joseph placed his father and his brethren, and gave them a
        possession in the land of Egypt, in the best of the land, in
        the land of Rameses, as Pharaoh had commanded.

047:012 And Joseph nourished his father, and his brethren, and all his
        father's household, with bread, according to their families.

047:013 And there was no bread in all the land; for the famine was
        very sore, so that the land of Egypt and all the land of
        Canaan fainted by reason of the famine.

047:014 And Joseph gathered up all the money that was found in the
        land of Egypt, and in the land of Canaan, for the corn which
        they bought: and Joseph brought the money into Pharaoh's
        house.

047:015 And when money failed in the land of Egypt, and in the land of
        Canaan, all the Egyptians came unto Joseph, and said, Give us
        bread: for why should we die in thy presence? for the money
        faileth.

047:016 And Joseph said, Give your cattle; and I will give you for
        your cattle, if money fail.

047:017 And they brought their cattle unto Joseph: and Joseph gave
        them bread in exchange for horses, and for the flocks, and for
        the cattle of the herds, and for the asses: and he fed them
        with bread for all their cattle for that year.

047:018 When that year was ended, they came unto him the second year,
        and said unto him, We will not hide it from my lord, how that
        our money is spent; my lord also hath our herds of cattle;
        there is not ought left in the sight of my lord, but our
        bodies, and our lands:

047:019 Wherefore shall we die before thine eyes, both we and our
        land? buy us and our land for bread, and we and our land will
        be servants unto Pharaoh: and give us seed, that we may live,
        and not die, that the land be not desolate.

047:020 And Joseph bought all the land of Egypt for Pharaoh; for the
        Egyptians sold every man his field, because the famine
        prevailed over them: so the land became Pharaoh's.

047:021 And as for the people, he removed them to cities from one end
        of the borders of Egypt even to the other end thereof.

047:022 Only the land of the priests bought he not; for the priests
        had a portion assigned them of Pharaoh, and did eat their
        portion which Pharaoh gave them: wherefore they sold not their
        lands.

047:023 Then Joseph said unto the people, Behold, I have bought you
        this day and your land for Pharaoh: lo, here is seed for you,
        and ye shall sow the land.

047:024 And it shall come to pass in the increase, that ye shall give
        the fifth part unto Pharaoh, and four parts shall be your own,
        for seed of the field, and for your food, and for them of your
        households, and for food for your little ones.

047:025 And they said, Thou hast saved our lives: let us find grace in
        the sight of my lord, and we will be Pharaoh's servants.

047:026 And Joseph made it a law over the land of Egypt unto this day,
        that Pharaoh should have the fifth part, except the land of
        the priests only, which became not Pharaoh's.

047:027 And Israel dwelt in the land of Egypt, in the country of
        Goshen; and they had possessions therein, and grew, and
        multiplied exceedingly.

047:028 And Jacob lived in the land of Egypt seventeen years: so the
        whole age of Jacob was an hundred forty and seven years.

047:029 And the time drew nigh that Israel must die: and he called his
        son Joseph, and said unto him, If now I have found grace in
        thy sight, put, I pray thee, thy hand under my thigh, and deal
        kindly and truly with me; bury me not, I pray thee, in Egypt:

047:030 But I will lie with my fathers, and thou shalt carry me out of
        Egypt, and bury me in their buryingplace. And he said, I will
        do as thou hast said.

047:031 And he said, Swear unto me. And he sware unto him. And Israel
        bowed himself upon the bed's head.

048:001 And it came to pass after these things, that one told Joseph,
        Behold, thy father is sick: and he took with him his two sons,
        Manasseh and Ephraim.

048:002 And one told Jacob, and said, Behold, thy son Joseph cometh
        unto thee: and Israel strengthened himself, and sat upon the
        bed.

048:003 And Jacob said unto Joseph, God Almighty appeared unto me at
        Luz in the land of Canaan, and blessed me,

048:004 And said unto me, Behold, I will make thee fruitful, and
        multiply thee, and I will make of thee a multitude of people;
        and will give this land to thy seed after thee for an
        everlasting possession.

048:005 And now thy two sons, Ephraim and Manasseh, which were born
        unto thee in the land of Egypt before I came unto thee into
        Egypt, are mine; as Reuben and Simeon, they shall be mine.

048:006 And thy issue, which thou begettest after them, shall be
        thine, and shall be called after the name of their brethren in
        their inheritance.

048:007 And as for me, when I came from Padan, Rachel died by me in
        the land of Canaan in the way, when yet there was but a little
        way to come unto Ephrath: and I buried her there in the way of
        Ephrath; the same is Bethlehem.

048:008 And Israel beheld Joseph's sons, and said, Who are these?

048:009 And Joseph said unto his father, They are my sons, whom God
        hath given me in this place. And he said, Bring them, I pray
        thee, unto me, and I will bless them.

048:010 Now the eyes of Israel were dim for age, so that he could not
        see. And he brought them near unto him; and he kissed them,
        and embraced them.

048:011 And Israel said unto Joseph, I had not thought to see thy
        face: and, lo, God hath shewed me also thy seed.

048:012 And Joseph brought them out from between his knees, and he
        bowed himself with his face to the earth.

048:013 And Joseph took them both, Ephraim in his right hand toward
        Israel's left hand, and Manasseh in his left hand toward
        Israel's right hand, and brought them near unto him.

048:014 And Israel stretched out his right hand, and laid it upon
        Ephraim's head, who was the younger, and his left hand upon
        Manasseh's head, guiding his hands wittingly; for Manasseh was
        the firstborn.

048:015 And he blessed Joseph, and said, God, before whom my fathers
        Abraham and Isaac did walk, the God which fed me all my life
        long unto this day,

048:016 The Angel which redeemed me from all evil, bless the lads; and
        let my name be named on them, and the name of my fathers
        Abraham and Isaac; and let them grow into a multitude in the
        midst of the earth.

048:017 And when Joseph saw that his father laid his right hand upon
        the head of Ephraim, it displeased him: and he held up his
        father's hand, to remove it from Ephraim's head unto
        Manasseh's head.

048:018 And Joseph said unto his father, Not so, my father: for this
        is the firstborn; put thy right hand upon his head.

048:019 And his father refused, and said, I know it, my son, I know
        it: he also shall become a people, and he also shall be great:
        but truly his younger brother shall be greater than he, and
        his seed shall become a multitude of nations.

048:020 And he blessed them that day, saying, In thee shall Israel
        bless, saying, God make thee as Ephraim and as Manasseh: and
        he set Ephraim before Manasseh.

048:021 And Israel said unto Joseph, Behold, I die: but God shall be
        with you, and bring you again unto the land of your fathers.

048:022 Moreover I have given to thee one portion above thy brethren,
        which I took out of the hand of the Amorite with my sword and
        with my bow.

049:001 And Jacob called unto his sons, and said, Gather yourselves
        together, that I may tell you that which shall befall you in
        the last days.

049:002 Gather yourselves together, and hear, ye sons of Jacob; and
        hearken unto Israel your father.

049:003 Reuben, thou art my firstborn, my might, and the beginning of
        my strength, the excellency of dignity, and the excellency of
        power:

049:004 Unstable as water, thou shalt not excel; because thou wentest
        up to thy father's bed; then defiledst thou it: he went up to
        my couch.

049:005 Simeon and Levi are brethren; instruments of cruelty are in
        their habitations.

049:006 O my soul, come not thou into their secret; unto their
        assembly, mine honour, be not thou united: for in their anger
        they slew a man, and in their selfwill they digged down a
        wall.

049:007 Cursed be their anger, for it was fierce; and their wrath, for
        it was cruel: I will divide them in Jacob, and scatter them in
        Israel.

049:008 Judah, thou art he whom thy brethren shall praise: thy hand
        shall be in the neck of thine enemies; thy father's children
        shall bow down before thee.

049:009 Judah is a lion's whelp: from the prey, my son, thou art gone
        up: he stooped down, he couched as a lion, and as an old lion;
        who shall rouse him up?

049:010 The sceptre shall not depart from Judah, nor a lawgiver from
        between his feet, until Shiloh come; and unto him shall the
        gathering of the people be.

049:011 Binding his foal unto the vine, and his ass's colt unto the
        choice vine; he washed his garments in wine, and his clothes
        in the blood of grapes:

049:012 His eyes shall be red with wine, and his teeth white with
        milk.

049:013 Zebulun shall dwell at the haven of the sea; and he shall be
        for an haven of ships; and his border shall be unto Zidon.

049:014 Issachar is a strong ass couching down between two burdens:

049:015 And he saw that rest was good, and the land that it was
        pleasant; and bowed his shoulder to bear, and became a servant
        unto tribute.

049:016 Dan shall judge his people, as one of the tribes of Israel.

049:017 Dan shall be a serpent by the way, an adder in the path, that
        biteth the horse heels, so that his rider shall fall backward.

049:018 I have waited for thy salvation, O LORD.

049:019 Gad, a troop shall overcome him: but he shall overcome at the
        last.

049:020 Out of Asher his bread shall be fat, and he shall yield royal
        dainties.

049:021 Naphtali is a hind let loose: he giveth goodly words.

049:022 Joseph is a fruitful bough, even a fruitful bough by a well;
        whose branches run over the wall:

049:023 The archers have sorely grieved him, and shot at him, and
        hated him:

049:024 But his bow abode in strength, and the arms of his hands were
        made strong by the hands of the mighty God of Jacob; (from
        thence is the shepherd, the stone of Israel:)

049:025 Even by the God of thy father, who shall help thee; and by the
        Almighty, who shall bless thee with blessings of heaven above,
        blessings of the deep that lieth under, blessings of the
        breasts, and of the womb:

049:026 The blessings of thy father have prevailed above the blessings
        of my progenitors unto the utmost bound of the everlasting
        hills: they shall be on the head of Joseph, and on the crown
        of the head of him that was separate from his brethren.

049:027 Benjamin shall ravin as a wolf: in the morning he shall devour
        the prey, and at night he shall divide the spoil.

049:028 All these are the twelve tribes of Israel: and this is it that
        their father spake unto them, and blessed them; every one
        according to his blessing he blessed them.

049:029 And he charged them, and said unto them, I am to be gathered
        unto my people: bury me with my fathers in the cave that is in
        the field of Ephron the Hittite,

049:030 In the cave that is in the field of Machpelah, which is before
        Mamre, in the land of Canaan, which Abraham bought with the
        field of Ephron the Hittite for a possession of a
        buryingplace.

049:031 There they buried Abraham and Sarah his wife; there they
        buried Isaac and Rebekah his wife; and there I buried Leah.

049:032 The purchase of the field and of the cave that is therein was
        from the children of Heth.

049:033 And when Jacob had made an end of commanding his sons, he
        gathered up his feet into the bed, and yielded up the ghost,
        and was gathered unto his people.

050:001 And Joseph fell upon his father's face, and wept upon him, and
        kissed him.

050:002 And Joseph commanded his servants the physicians to embalm his
        father: and the physicians embalmed Israel.

050:003 And forty days were fulfilled for him; for so are fulfilled
        the days of those which are embalmed: and the Egyptians
        mourned for him threescore and ten days.

050:004 And when the days of his mourning were past, Joseph spake unto
        the house of Pharaoh, saying, If now I have found grace in
        your eyes, speak, I pray you, in the ears of Pharaoh, saying,

050:005 My father made me swear, saying, Lo, I die: in my grave which
        I have digged for me in the land of Canaan, there shalt thou
        bury me. Now therefore let me go up, I pray thee, and bury my
        father, and I will come again.

050:006 And Pharaoh said, Go up, and bury thy father, according as he
        made thee swear.

050:007 And Joseph went up to bury his father: and with him went up
        all the servants of Pharaoh, the elders of his house, and all
        the elders of the land of Egypt,

050:008 And all the house of Joseph, and his brethren, and his
        father's house: only their little ones, and their flocks, and
        their herds, they left in the land of Goshen.

050:009 And there went up with him both chariots and horsemen: and it
        was a very great company.

050:010 And they came to the threshingfloor of Atad, which is beyond
        Jordan, and there they mourned with a great and very sore
        lamentation: and he made a mourning for his father seven days.

050:011 And when the inhabitants of the land, the Canaanites, saw the
        mourning in the floor of Atad, they said, This is a grievous
        mourning to the Egyptians: wherefore the name of it was called
        Abelmizraim, which is beyond Jordan.

050:012 And his sons did unto him according as he commanded them:

050:013 For his sons carried him into the land of Canaan, and buried
        him in the cave of the field of Machpelah, which Abraham
        bought with the field for a possession of a buryingplace of
        Ephron the Hittite, before Mamre.

050:014 And Joseph returned into Egypt, he, and his brethren, and all
        that went up with him to bury his father, after he had buried
        his father.

050:015 And when Joseph's brethren saw that their father was dead,
        they said, Joseph will peradventure hate us, and will
        certainly requite us all the evil which we did unto him.

050:016 And they sent a messenger unto Joseph, saying, Thy father did
        command before he died, saying,

050:017 So shall ye say unto Joseph, Forgive, I pray thee now, the
        trespass of thy brethren, and their sin; for they did unto
        thee evil: and now, we pray thee, forgive the trespass of the
        servants of the God of thy father. And Joseph wept when they
        spake unto him.

050:018 And his brethren also went and fell down before his face; and
        they said, Behold, we be thy servants.

050:019 And Joseph said unto them, Fear not: for am I in the place of
        God?

050:020 But as for you, ye thought evil against me; but God meant it
        unto good, to bring to pass, as it is this day, to save much
        people alive.

050:021 Now therefore fear ye not: I will nourish you, and your little
        ones. And he comforted them, and spake kindly unto them.

050:022 And Joseph dwelt in Egypt, he, and his father's house: and
        Joseph lived an hundred and ten years.

050:023 And Joseph saw Ephraim's children of the third generation: the
        children also of Machir the son of Manasseh were brought up
        upon Joseph's knees.

050:024 And Joseph said unto his brethren, I die: and God will surely
        visit you, and bring you out of this land unto the land which
        he sware to Abraham, to Isaac, and to Jacob.

050:025 And Joseph took an oath of the children of Israel, saying, God
        will surely visit you, and ye shall carry up my bones from
        hence.

050:026 So Joseph died, being an hundred and ten years old: and they
        embalmed him, and he was put in a coffin in Egypt.

Book 02	Exodus

001:001 Now these are the names of the children of Israel, which came
        into Egypt; every man and his household came with Jacob.

001:002 Reuben, Simeon, Levi, and Judah,

001:003 Issachar, Zebulun, and Benjamin,

001:004 Dan, and Naphtali, Gad, and Asher.

001:005 And all the souls that came out of the loins of Jacob were
        seventy souls: for Joseph was in Egypt already.

001:006 And Joseph died, and all his brethren, and all that
        generation.

001:007 And the children of Israel were fruitful, and increased
        abundantly, and multiplied, and waxed exceeding mighty; and
        the land was filled with them.

001:008 Now there arose up a new king over Egypt, which knew not
        Joseph.

001:009 And he said unto his people, Behold, the people of the
        children of Israel are more and mightier than we:

001:010 Come on, let us deal wisely with them; lest they multiply, and
        it come to pass, that, when there falleth out any war, they
        join also unto our enemies, and fight against us, and so get
        them up out of the land.

001:011 Therefore they did set over them taskmasters to afflict them
        with their burdens. And they built for Pharaoh treasure
        cities, Pithom and Raamses.

001:012 But the more they afflicted them, the more they multiplied and
        grew. And they were grieved because of the children of Israel.

001:013 And the Egyptians made the children of Israel to serve with
        rigour:

001:014 And they made their lives bitter with hard bondage, in morter,
        and in brick, and in all manner of service in the field: all
        their service, wherein they made them serve, was with rigour.

001:015 And the king of Egypt spake to the Hebrew midwives, of which
        the name of the one was Shiphrah, and the name of the other
        Puah:

001:016 And he said, When ye do the office of a midwife to the Hebrew
        women, and see them upon the stools; if it be a son, then ye
        shall kill him: but if it be a daughter, then she shall live.

001:017 But the midwives feared God, and did not as the king of Egypt
        commanded them, but saved the men children alive.

001:018 And the king of Egypt called for the midwives, and said unto
        them, Why have ye done this thing, and have saved the men
        children alive?

001:019 And the midwives said unto Pharaoh, Because the Hebrew women
        are not as the Egyptian women; for they are lively, and are
        delivered ere the midwives come in unto them.

001:020 Therefore God dealt well with the midwives: and the people
        multiplied, and waxed very mighty.

001:021 And it came to pass, because the midwives feared God, that he
        made them houses.

001:022 And Pharaoh charged all his people, saying, Every son that is
        born ye shall cast into the river, and every daughter ye shall
        save alive.

002:001 And there went a man of the house of Levi, and took to wife a
        daughter of Levi.

002:002 And the woman conceived, and bare a son: and when she saw him
        that he was a goodly child, she hid him three months.

002:003 And when she could not longer hide him, she took for him an
        ark of bulrushes, and daubed it with slime and with pitch, and
        put the child therein; and she laid it in the flags by the
        river's brink.

002:004 And his sister stood afar off, to wit what would be done to
        him.

002:005 And the daughter of Pharaoh came down to wash herself at the
        river; and her maidens walked along by the river's side; and
        when she saw the ark among the flags, she sent her maid to
        fetch it.

002:006 And when she had opened it, she saw the child: and, behold,
        the babe wept. And she had compassion on him, and said, This
        is one of the Hebrews' children.

002:007 Then said his sister to Pharaoh's daughter, Shall I go and
        call to thee a nurse of the Hebrew women, that she may nurse
        the child for thee?

002:008 And Pharaoh's daughter said to her, Go. And the maid went and
        called the child's mother.

002:009 And Pharaoh's daughter said unto her, Take this child away,
        and nurse it for me, and I will give thee thy wages. And the
        women took the child, and nursed it.

002:010 And the child grew, and she brought him unto Pharaoh's
        daughter, and he became her son. And she called his name
        Moses: and she said, Because I drew him out of the water.

002:011 And it came to pass in those days, when Moses was grown, that
        he went out unto his brethren, and looked on their burdens:
        and he spied an Egyptian smiting an Hebrew, one of his
        brethren.

002:012 And he looked this way and that way, and when he saw that
        there was no man, he slew the Egyptian, and hid him in the
        sand.

002:013 And when he went out the second day, behold, two men of the
        Hebrews strove together: and he said to him that did the
        wrong, Wherefore smitest thou thy fellow?

002:014 And he said, Who made thee a prince and a judge over us?
        intendest thou to kill me, as thou killedst the Egyptian? And
        Moses feared, and said, Surely this thing is known.

002:015 Now when Pharaoh heard this thing, he sought to slay Moses.
        But Moses fled from the face of Pharaoh, and dwelt in the land
        of Midian: and he sat down by a well.

002:016 Now the priest of Midian had seven daughters: and they came
        and drew water, and filled the troughs to water their father's
        flock.

002:017 And the shepherds came and drove them away: but Moses stood up
        and helped them, and watered their flock.

002:018 And when they came to Reuel their father, he said, How is it
        that ye are come so soon to day?

002:019 And they said, An Egyptian delivered us out of the hand of the
        shepherds, and also drew water enough for us, and watered the
        flock.

002:020 And he said unto his daughters, And where is he? why is it
        that ye have left the man? call him, that he may eat bread.

002:021 And Moses was content to dwell with the man: and he gave Moses
        Zipporah his daughter.

002:022 And she bare him a son, and he called his name Gershom: for he
        said, I have been a stranger in a strange land.

002:023 And it came to pass in process of time, that the king of Egypt
        died: and the children of Israel sighed by reason of the
        bondage, and they cried, and their cry came up unto God by
        reason of the bondage.

002:024 And God heard their groaning, and God remembered his covenant
        with Abraham, with Isaac, and with Jacob.

002:025 And God looked upon the children of Israel, and God had
        respect unto them.

003:001 Now Moses kept the flock of Jethro his father in law, the
        priest of Midian: and he led the flock to the backside of the
        desert, and came to the mountain of God, even to Horeb.

003:002 And the angel of the LORD appeared unto him in a flame of fire
        out of the midst of a bush: and he looked, and, behold, the
        bush burned with fire, and the bush was not consumed.

003:003 And Moses said, I will now turn aside, and see this great
        sight, why the bush is not burnt.

003:004 And when the LORD saw that he turned aside to see, God called
        unto him out of the midst of the bush, and said, Moses, Moses.
        And he said, Here am I.

003:005 And he said, Draw not nigh hither: put off thy shoes from off
        thy feet, for the place whereon thou standest is holy ground.

003:006 Moreover he said, I am the God of thy father, the God of
        Abraham, the God of Isaac, and the God of Jacob. And Moses hid
        his face; for he was afraid to look upon God.

003:007 And the LORD said, I have surely seen the affliction of my
        people which are in Egypt, and have heard their cry by reason
        of their taskmasters; for I know their sorrows;

003:008 And I am come down to deliver them out of the hand of the
        Egyptians, and to bring them up out of that land unto a good
        land and a large, unto a land flowing with milk and honey;
        unto the place of the Canaanites, and the Hittites, and the
        Amorites, and the Perizzites, and the Hivites, and the
        Jebusites.

003:009 Now therefore, behold, the cry of the children of Israel is
        come unto me: and I have also seen the oppression wherewith
        the Egyptians oppress them.

003:010 Come now therefore, and I will send thee unto Pharaoh, that
        thou mayest bring forth my people the children of Israel out
        of Egypt.

003:011 And Moses said unto God, Who am I, that I should go unto
        Pharaoh, and that I should bring forth the children of Israel
        out of Egypt?

003:012 And he said, Certainly I will be with thee; and this shall be
        a token unto thee, that I have sent thee: When thou hast
        brought forth the people out of Egypt, ye shall serve God upon
        this mountain.

003:013 And Moses said unto God, Behold, when I come unto the children
        of Israel, and shall say unto them, The God of your fathers
        hath sent me unto you; and they shall say to me, What is his
        name? what shall I say unto them?

003:014 And God said unto Moses, I AM THAT I AM: and he said, Thus
        shalt thou say unto the children of Israel, I AM hath sent me
        unto you.

003:015 And God said moreover unto Moses, Thus shalt thou say unto the
        children of Israel, the LORD God of your fathers, the God of
        Abraham, the God of Isaac, and the God of Jacob, hath sent me
        unto you: this is my name for ever, and this is my memorial
        unto all generations.

003:016 Go, and gather the elders of Israel together, and say unto
        them, The LORD God of your fathers, the God of Abraham, of
        Isaac, and of Jacob, appeared unto me, saying, I have surely
        visited you, and seen that which is done to you in Egypt:

003:017 And I have said, I will bring you up out of the affliction of
        Egypt unto the land of the Canaanites, and the Hittites, and
        the Amorites, and the Perizzites, and the Hivites, and the
        Jebusites, unto a land flowing with milk and honey.

003:018 And they shall hearken to thy voice: and thou shalt come, thou
        and the elders of Israel, unto the king of Egypt, and ye shall
        say unto him, The LORD God of the Hebrews hath met with us:
        and now let us go, we beseech thee, three days' journey into
        the wilderness, that we may sacrifice to the LORD our God.

003:019 And I am sure that the king of Egypt will not let you go, no,
        not by a mighty hand.

003:020 And I will stretch out my hand, and smite Egypt with all my
        wonders which I will do in the midst thereof: and after that
        he will let you go.

003:021 And I will give this people favour in the sight of the
        Egyptians: and it shall come to pass, that, when ye go, ye
        shall not go empty.

003:022 But every woman shall borrow of her neighbour, and of her that
        sojourneth in her house, jewels of silver, and jewels of gold,
        and raiment: and ye shall put them upon your sons, and upon
        your daughters; and ye shall spoil the Egyptians.

004:001 And Moses answered and said, But, behold, they will not
        believe me, nor hearken unto my voice: for they will say, The
        LORD hath not appeared unto thee.

004:002 And the LORD said unto him, What is that in thine hand? And he
        said, A rod.

004:003 And he said, Cast it on the ground. And he cast it on the
        ground, and it became a serpent; and Moses fled from before
        it.

004:004 And the LORD said unto Moses, Put forth thine hand, and take
        it by the tail. And he put forth his hand, and caught it, and
        it became a rod in his hand:

004:005 That they may believe that the LORD God of their fathers, the
        God of Abraham, the God of Isaac, and the God of Jacob, hath
        appeared unto thee.

004:006 And the LORD said furthermore unto him, Put now thine hand
        into thy bosom. And he put his hand into his bosom: and when
        he took it out, behold, his hand was leprous as snow.

004:007 And he said, Put thine hand into thy bosom again. And he put
        his hand into his bosom again; and plucked it out of his
        bosom, and, behold, it was turned again as his other flesh.

004:008 And it shall come to pass, if they will not believe thee,
        neither hearken to the voice of the first sign, that they will
        believe the voice of the latter sign.

004:009 And it shall come to pass, if they will not believe also these
        two signs, neither hearken unto thy voice, that thou shalt
        take of the water of the river, and pour it upon the dry land:
        and the water which thou takest out of the river shall become
        blood upon the dry land.

004:010 And Moses said unto the LORD, O my LORD, I am not eloquent,
        neither heretofore, nor since thou hast spoken unto thy
        servant: but I am slow of speech, and of a slow tongue.

004:011 And the LORD said unto him, Who hath made man's mouth? or who
        maketh the dumb, or deaf, or the seeing, or the blind? have
        not I the LORD?

004:012 Now therefore go, and I will be with thy mouth, and teach thee
        what thou shalt say.

004:013 And he said, O my LORD, send, I pray thee, by the hand of him
        whom thou wilt send.

004:014 And the anger of the LORD was kindled against Moses, and he
        said, Is not Aaron the Levite thy brother? I know that he can
        speak well. And also, behold, he cometh forth to meet thee:
        and when he seeth thee, he will be glad in his heart.

004:015 And thou shalt speak unto him, and put words in his mouth: and
        I will be with thy mouth, and with his mouth, and will teach
        you what ye shall do.

004:016 And he shall be thy spokesman unto the people: and he shall
        be, even he shall be to thee instead of a mouth, and thou
        shalt be to him instead of God.

004:017 And thou shalt take this rod in thine hand, wherewith thou
        shalt do signs.

004:018 And Moses went and returned to Jethro his father in law, and
        said unto him, Let me go, I pray thee, and return unto my
        brethren which are in Egypt, and see whether they be yet
        alive. And Jethro said to Moses, Go in peace.

004:019 And the LORD said unto Moses in Midian, Go, return into Egypt:
        for all the men are dead which sought thy life.

004:020 And Moses took his wife and his sons, and set them upon an
        ass, and he returned to the land of Egypt: and Moses took the
        rod of God in his hand.

004:021 And the LORD said unto Moses, When thou goest to return into
        Egypt, see that thou do all those wonders before Pharaoh,
        which I have put in thine hand: but I will harden his heart,
        that he shall not let the people go.

004:022 And thou shalt say unto Pharaoh, Thus saith the LORD, Israel
        is my son, even my firstborn:

004:023 And I say unto thee, Let my son go, that he may serve me: and
        if thou refuse to let him go, behold, I will slay thy son,
        even thy firstborn.

004:024 And it came to pass by the way in the inn, that the LORD met
        him, and sought to kill him.

004:025 Then Zipporah took a sharp stone, and cut off the foreskin of
        her son, and cast it at his feet, and said, Surely a bloody
        husband art thou to me.

004:026 So he let him go: then she said, A bloody husband thou art,
        because of the circumcision.

004:027 And the LORD said to Aaron, Go into the wilderness to meet
        Moses. And he went, and met him in the mount of God, and
        kissed him.

004:028 And Moses told Aaron all the words of the LORD who had sent
        him, and all the signs which he had commanded him.

004:029 And Moses and Aaron went and gathered together all the elders
        of the children of Israel:

004:030 And Aaron spake all the words which the LORD had spoken unto
        Moses, and did the signs in the sight of the people.

004:031 And the people believed: and when they heard that the LORD had
        visited the children of Israel, and that he had looked upon
        their affliction, then they bowed their heads and worshipped.

005:001 And afterward Moses and Aaron went in, and told Pharaoh, Thus
        saith the LORD God of Israel, Let my people go, that they may
        hold a feast unto me in the wilderness.

005:002 And Pharaoh said, Who is the LORD, that I should obey his
        voice to let Israel go? I know not the LORD, neither will I
        let Israel go.

005:003 And they said, The God of the Hebrews hath met with us: let us
        go, we pray thee, three days' journey into the desert, and
        sacrifice unto the LORD our God; lest he fall upon us with
        pestilence, or with the sword.

005:004 And the king of Egypt said unto them, Wherefore do ye, Moses
        and Aaron, let the people from their works? get you unto your
        burdens.

005:005 And Pharaoh said, Behold, the people of the land now are many,
        and ye make them rest from their burdens.

005:006 And Pharaoh commanded the same day the taskmasters of the
        people, and their officers, saying,

005:007 Ye shall no more give the people straw to make brick, as
        heretofore: let them go and gather straw for themselves.

005:008 And the tale of the bricks, which they did make heretofore, ye
        shall lay upon them; ye shall not diminish ought thereof: for
        they be idle; therefore they cry, saying, Let us go and
        sacrifice to our God.

005:009 Let there more work be laid upon the men, that they may labour
        therein; and let them not regard vain words.

005:010 And the taskmasters of the people went out, and their
        officers, and they spake to the people, saying, Thus saith
        Pharaoh, I will not give you straw.

005:011 Go ye, get you straw where ye can find it: yet not ought of
        your work shall be diminished.

005:012 So the people were scattered abroad throughout all the land of
        Egypt to gather stubble instead of straw.

005:013 And the taskmasters hasted them, saying, Fulfil your works,
        your daily tasks, as when there was straw.

005:014 And the officers of the children of Israel, which Pharaoh's
        taskmasters had set over them, were beaten, and demanded,
        Wherefore have ye not fulfilled your task in making brick both
        yesterday and to day, as heretofore?

005:015 Then the officers of the children of Israel came and cried
        unto Pharaoh, saying, Wherefore dealest thou thus with thy
        servants?

005:016 There is no straw given unto thy servants, and they say to us,
        Make brick: and, behold, thy servants are beaten; but the
        fault is in thine own people.

005:017 But he said, Ye are idle, ye are idle: therefore ye say, Let
        us go and do sacrifice to the LORD.

005:018 Go therefore now, and work; for there shall no straw be given
        you, yet shall ye deliver the tale of bricks.

005:019 And the officers of the children of Israel did see that they
        were in evil case, after it was said, Ye shall not minish
        ought from your bricks of your daily task.

005:020 And they met Moses and Aaron, who stood in the way, as they
        came forth from Pharaoh:

005:021 And they said unto them, The LORD look upon you, and judge;
        because ye have made our savour to be abhorred in the eyes of
        Pharaoh, and in the eyes of his servants, to put a sword in
        their hand to slay us.

005:022 And Moses returned unto the LORD, and said, LORD, wherefore
        hast thou so evil entreated this people? why is it that thou
        hast sent me?

005:023 For since I came to Pharaoh to speak in thy name, he hath done
        evil to this people; neither hast thou delivered thy people at
        all.

006:001 Then the LORD said unto Moses, Now shalt thou see what I will
        do to Pharaoh: for with a strong hand shall he let them go,
        and with a strong hand shall he drive them out of his land.

006:002 And God spake unto Moses, and said unto him, I am the LORD:

006:003 And I appeared unto Abraham, unto Isaac, and unto Jacob, by
        the name of God Almighty, but by my name JEHOVAH was I not
        known to them.

006:004 And I have also established my covenant with them, to give
        them the land of Canaan, the land of their pilgrimage, wherein
        they were strangers.

006:005 And I have also heard the groaning of the children of Israel,
        whom the Egyptians keep in bondage; and I have remembered my
        covenant.

006:006 Wherefore say unto the children of Israel, I am the LORD, and
        I will bring you out from under the burdens of the Egyptians,
        and I will rid you out of their bondage, and I will redeem you
        with a stretched out arm, and with great judgments:

006:007 And I will take you to me for a people, and I will be to you a
        God: and ye shall know that I am the LORD your God, which
        bringeth you out from under the burdens of the Egyptians.

006:008 And I will bring you in unto the land, concerning the which I
        did swear to give it to Abraham, to Isaac, and to Jacob; and I
        will give it you for an heritage: I am the LORD.

006:009 And Moses spake so unto the children of Israel: but they
        hearkened not unto Moses for anguish of spirit, and for cruel
        bondage.

006:010 And the LORD spake unto Moses, saying,

006:011 Go in, speak unto Pharaoh king of Egypt, that he let the
        children of Israel go out of his land.

006:012 And Moses spake before the LORD, saying, Behold, the children
        of Israel have not hearkened unto me; how then shall Pharaoh
        hear me, who am of uncircumcised lips?

006:013 And the LORD spake unto Moses and unto Aaron, and gave them a
        charge unto the children of Israel, and unto Pharaoh king of
        Egypt, to bring the children of Israel out of the land of
        Egypt.

006:014 These be the heads of their fathers' houses: The sons of
        Reuben the firstborn of Israel; Hanoch, and Pallu, Hezron, and
        Carmi: these be the families of Reuben.

006:015 And the sons of Simeon; Jemuel, and Jamin, and Ohad, and
        Jachin, and Zohar, and Shaul the son of a Canaanitish woman:
        these are the families of Simeon.

006:016 And these are the names of the sons of Levi according to their
        generations; Gershon, and Kohath, and Merari: and the years of
        the life of Levi were an hundred thirty and seven years.

006:017 The sons of Gershon; Libni, and Shimi, according to their
        families.

006:018 And the sons of Kohath; Amram, and Izhar, and Hebron, and
        Uzziel: and the years of the life of Kohath were an hundred
        thirty and three years.

006:019 And the sons of Merari; Mahali and Mushi: these are the
        families of Levi according to their generations.

006:020 And Amram took him Jochebed his father's sister to wife; and
        she bare him Aaron and Moses: and the years of the life of
        Amram were an hundred and thirty and seven years.

006:021 And the sons of Izhar; Korah, and Nepheg, and Zichri.

006:022 And the sons of Uzziel; Mishael, and Elzaphan, and Zithri.

006:023 And Aaron took him Elisheba, daughter of Amminadab, sister of
        Naashon, to wife; and she bare him Nadab, and Abihu, Eleazar,
        and Ithamar.

006:024 And the sons of Korah; Assir, and Elkanah, and Abiasaph: these
        are the families of the Korhites.

006:025 And Eleazar Aaron's son took him one of the daughters of
        Putiel to wife; and she bare him Phinehas: these are the heads
        of the fathers of the Levites according to their families.

006:026 These are that Aaron and Moses, to whom the LORD said, Bring
        out the children of Israel from the land of Egypt according to
        their armies.

006:027 These are they which spake to Pharaoh king of Egypt, to bring
        out the children of Israel from Egypt: these are that Moses
        and Aaron.

006:028 And it came to pass on the day when the LORD spake unto Moses
        in the land of Egypt,

006:029 That the LORD spake unto Moses, saying, I am the LORD: speak
        thou unto Pharaoh king of Egypt all that I say unto thee.

006:030 And Moses said before the LORD, Behold, I am of uncircumcised
        lips, and how shall Pharaoh hearken unto me?

007:001 And the LORD said unto Moses, See, I have made thee a god to
        Pharaoh: and Aaron thy brother shall be thy prophet.

007:002 Thou shalt speak all that I command thee: and Aaron thy
        brother shall speak unto Pharaoh, that he send the children of
        Israel out of his land.

007:003 And I will harden Pharaoh's heart, and multiply my signs and
        my wonders in the land of Egypt.

007:004 But Pharaoh shall not hearken unto you, that I may lay my hand
        upon Egypt, and bring forth mine armies, and my people the
        children of Israel, out of the land of Egypt by great
        judgments.

007:005 And the Egyptians shall know that I am the LORD, when I
        stretch forth mine hand upon Egypt, and bring out the children
        of Israel from among them.

007:006 And Moses and Aaron did as the LORD commanded them, so did
        they.

007:007 And Moses was fourscore years old, and Aaron fourscore and
        three years old, when they spake unto Pharaoh.

007:008 And the LORD spake unto Moses and unto Aaron, saying,

007:009 When Pharaoh shall speak unto you, saying, Shew a miracle for
        you: then thou shalt say unto Aaron, Take thy rod, and cast it
        before Pharaoh, and it shall become a serpent.

007:010 And Moses and Aaron went in unto Pharaoh, and they did so as
        the LORD had commanded: and Aaron cast down his rod before
        Pharaoh, and before his servants, and it became a serpent.

007:011 Then Pharaoh also called the wise men and the sorcerers: now
        the magicians of Egypt, they also did in like manner with
        their enchantments.

007:012 For they cast down every man his rod, and they became
        serpents: but Aaron's rod swallowed up their rods.

007:013 And he hardened Pharaoh's heart, that he hearkened not unto
        them; as the LORD had said.

007:014 And the LORD said unto Moses, Pharaoh's heart is hardened, he
        refuseth to let the people go.

007:015 Get thee unto Pharaoh in the morning; lo, he goeth out unto
        the water; and thou shalt stand by the river's brink against
        he come; and the rod which was turned to a serpent shalt thou
        take in thine hand.

007:016 And thou shalt say unto him, The LORD God of the Hebrews hath
        sent me unto thee, saying, Let my people go, that they may
        serve me in the wilderness: and, behold, hitherto thou
        wouldest not hear.

007:017 Thus saith the LORD, In this thou shalt know that I am the
        LORD: behold, I will smite with the rod that is in mine hand
        upon the waters which are in the river, and they shall be
        turned to blood.

007:018 And the fish that is in the river shall die, and the river
        shall stink; and the Egyptians shall lothe to drink of the
        water of the river.

007:019 And the LORD spake unto Moses, Say unto Aaron, Take thy rod,
        and stretch out thine hand upon the waters of Egypt, upon
        their streams, upon their rivers, and upon their ponds, and
        upon all their pools of water, that they may become blood; and
        that there may be blood throughout all the land of Egypt, both
        in vessels of wood, and in vessels of stone.

007:020 And Moses and Aaron did so, as the LORD commanded; and he
        lifted up the rod, and smote the waters that were in the
        river, in the sight of Pharaoh, and in the sight of his
        servants; and all the waters that were in the river were
        turned to blood.

007:021 And the fish that was in the river died; and the river stank,
        and the Egyptians could not drink of the water of the river;
        and there was blood throughout all the land of Egypt.

007:022 And the magicians of Egypt did so with their enchantments: and
        Pharaoh's heart was hardened, neither did he hearken unto
        them; as the LORD had said.

007:023 And Pharaoh turned and went into his house, neither did he set
        his heart to this also.

007:024 And all the Egyptians digged round about the river for water
        to drink; for they could not drink of the water of the river.

007:025 And seven days were fulfilled, after that the LORD had smitten
        the river.

008:001 And the LORD spake unto Moses, Go unto Pharaoh, and say unto
        him, Thus saith the LORD, Let my people go, that they may
        serve me.

008:002 And if thou refuse to let them go, behold, I will smite all
        thy borders with frogs:

008:003 And the river shall bring forth frogs abundantly, which shall
        go up and come into thine house, and into thy bedchamber, and
        upon thy bed, and into the house of thy servants, and upon thy
        people, and into thine ovens, and into thy kneadingtroughs:

008:004 And the frogs shall come up both on thee, and upon thy people,
        and upon all thy servants.

008:005 And the LORD spake unto Moses, Say unto Aaron, Stretch forth
        thine hand with thy rod over the streams, over the rivers, and
        over the ponds, and cause frogs to come up upon the land of
        Egypt.

008:006 And Aaron stretched out his hand over the waters of Egypt; and
        the frogs came up, and covered the land of Egypt.

008:007 And the magicians did so with their enchantments, and brought
        up frogs upon the land of Egypt.

008:008 Then Pharaoh called for Moses and Aaron, and said, Intreat the
        LORD, that he may take away the frogs from me, and from my
        people; and I will let the people go, that they may do
        sacrifice unto the LORD.

008:009 And Moses said unto Pharaoh, Glory over me: when shall I
        intreat for thee, and for thy servants, and for thy people, to
        destroy the frogs from thee and thy houses, that they may
        remain in the river only?

008:010 And he said, To morrow. And he said, Be it according to thy
        word: that thou mayest know that there is none like unto the
        LORD our God.

008:011 And the frogs shall depart from thee, and from thy houses, and
        from thy servants, and from thy people; they shall remain in
        the river only.

008:012 And Moses and Aaron went out from Pharaoh: and Moses cried
        unto the LORD because of the frogs which he had brought
        against Pharaoh.

008:013 And the LORD did according to the word of Moses; and the frogs
        died out of the houses, out of the villages, and out of the
        fields.

008:014 And they gathered them together upon heaps: and the land
        stank.

008:015 But when Pharaoh saw that there was respite, he hardened his
        heart, and hearkened not unto them; as the LORD had said.

008:016 And the LORD said unto Moses, Say unto Aaron, Stretch out thy
        rod, and smite the dust of the land, that it may become lice
        throughout all the land of Egypt.

008:017 And they did so; for Aaron stretched out his hand with his
        rod, and smote the dust of the earth, and it became lice in
        man, and in beast; all the dust of the land became lice
        throughout all the land of Egypt.

008:018 And the magicians did so with their enchantments to bring
        forth lice, but they could not: so there were lice upon man,
        and upon beast.

008:019 Then the magicians said unto Pharaoh, This is the finger of
        God: and Pharaoh's heart was hardened, and he hearkened not
        unto them; as the LORD had said.

008:020 And the LORD said unto Moses, Rise up early in the morning,
        and stand before Pharaoh; lo, he cometh forth to the water;
        and say unto him, Thus saith the LORD, Let my people go, that
        they may serve me.

008:021 Else, if thou wilt not let my people go, behold, I will send
        swarms of flies upon thee, and upon thy servants, and upon thy
        people, and into thy houses: and the houses of the Egyptians
        shall be full of swarms of flies, and also the ground whereon
        they are.

008:022 And I will sever in that day the land of Goshen, in which my
        people dwell, that no swarms of flies shall be there; to the
        end thou mayest know that I am the LORD in the midst of the
        earth.

008:023 And I will put a division between my people and thy people: to
        morrow shall this sign be.

008:024 And the LORD did so; and there came a grievous swarm of flies
        into the house of Pharaoh, and into his servants' houses, and
        into all the land of Egypt: the land was corrupted by reason
        of the swarm of flies.

008:025 And Pharaoh called for Moses and for Aaron, and said, Go ye,
        sacrifice to your God in the land.

008:026 And Moses said, It is not meet so to do; for we shall
        sacrifice the abomination of the Egyptians to the LORD our
        God: lo, shall we sacrifice the abomination of the Egyptians
        before their eyes, and will they not stone us?

008:027 We will go three days' journey into the wilderness, and
        sacrifice to the LORD our God, as he shall command us.

008:028 And Pharaoh said, I will let you go, that ye may sacrifice to
        the LORD your God in the wilderness; only ye shall not go very
        far away: intreat for me.

008:029 And Moses said, Behold, I go out from thee, and I will intreat
        the LORD that the swarms of flies may depart from Pharaoh,
        from his servants, and from his people, to morrow: but let not
        Pharaoh deal deceitfully any more in not letting the people go
        to sacrifice to the LORD.

008:030 And Moses went out from Pharaoh, and intreated the LORD.

008:031 And the LORD did according to the word of Moses; and he
        removed the swarms of flies from Pharaoh, from his servants,
        and from his people; there remained not one.

008:032 And Pharaoh hardened his heart at this time also, neither
        would he let the people go.

009:001 Then the LORD said unto Moses, Go in unto Pharaoh, and tell
        him, Thus saith the LORD God of the Hebrews, Let my people go,
        that they may serve me.

009:002 For if thou refuse to let them go, and wilt hold them still,

009:003 Behold, the hand of the LORD is upon thy cattle which is in
        the field, upon the horses, upon the asses, upon the camels,
        upon the oxen, and upon the sheep: there shall be a very
        grievous murrain.

009:004 And the LORD shall sever between the cattle of Israel and the
        cattle of Egypt: and there shall nothing die of all that is
        the children's of Israel.

009:005 And the LORD appointed a set time, saying, To morrow the LORD
        shall do this thing in the land.

009:006 And the LORD did that thing on the morrow, and all the cattle
        of Egypt died: but of the cattle of the children of Israel
        died not one.

009:007 And Pharaoh sent, and, behold, there was not one of the cattle
        of the Israelites dead. And the heart of Pharaoh was hardened,
        and he did not let the people go.

009:008 And the LORD said unto Moses and unto Aaron, Take to you
        handfuls of ashes of the furnace, and let Moses sprinkle it
        toward the heaven in the sight of Pharaoh.

009:009 And it shall become small dust in all the land of Egypt, and
        shall be a boil breaking forth with blains upon man, and upon
        beast, throughout all the land of Egypt.

009:010 And they took ashes of the furnace, and stood before Pharaoh;
        and Moses sprinkled it up toward heaven; and it became a boil
        breaking forth with blains upon man, and upon beast.

009:011 And the magicians could not stand before Moses because of the
        boils; for the boil was upon the magicians, and upon all the
        Egyptians.

009:012 And the LORD hardened the heart of Pharaoh, and he hearkened
        not unto them; as the LORD had spoken unto Moses.

009:013 And the LORD said unto Moses, Rise up early in the morning,
        and stand before Pharaoh, and say unto him, Thus saith the
        LORD God of the Hebrews, Let my people go, that they may serve
        me.

009:014 For I will at this time send all my plagues upon thine heart,
        and upon thy servants, and upon thy people; that thou mayest
        know that there is none like me in all the earth.

009:015 For now I will stretch out my hand, that I may smite thee and
        thy people with pestilence; and thou shalt be cut off from the
        earth.

009:016 And in very deed for this cause have I raised thee up, for to
        shew in thee my power; and that my name may be declared
        throughout all the earth.

009:017 As yet exaltest thou thyself against my people, that thou wilt
        not let them go?

009:018 Behold, to morrow about this time I will cause it to rain a
        very grievous hail, such as hath not been in Egypt since the
        foundation thereof even until now.

009:019 Send therefore now, and gather thy cattle, and all that thou
        hast in the field; for upon every man and beast which shall be
        found in the field, and shall not be brought home, the hail
        shall come down upon them, and they shall die.

009:020 He that feared the word of the LORD among the servants of
        Pharaoh made his servants and his cattle flee into the houses:

009:021 And he that regarded not the word of the LORD left his
        servants and his cattle in the field.

009:022 And the LORD said unto Moses, Stretch forth thine hand toward
        heaven, that there may be hail in all the land of Egypt, upon
        man, and upon beast, and upon every herb of the field,
        throughout the land of Egypt.

009:023 And Moses stretched forth his rod toward heaven: and the LORD
        sent thunder and hail, and the fire ran along upon the ground;
        and the LORD rained hail upon the land of Egypt.

009:024 So there was hail, and fire mingled with the hail, very
        grievous, such as there was none like it in all the land of
        Egypt since it became a nation.

009:025 And the hail smote throughout all the land of Egypt all that
        was in the field, both man and beast; and the hail smote every
        herb of the field, and brake every tree of the field.

009:026 Only in the land of Goshen, where the children of Israel were,
        was there no hail.

009:027 And Pharaoh sent, and called for Moses and Aaron, and said
        unto them, I have sinned this time: the LORD is righteous, and
        I and my people are wicked.

009:028 Intreat the LORD (for it is enough) that there be no more
        mighty thunderings and hail; and I will let you go, and ye
        shall stay no longer.

009:029 And Moses said unto him, As soon as I am gone out of the city,
        I will spread abroad my hands unto the LORD; and the thunder
        shall cease, neither shall there be any more hail; that thou
        mayest know how that the earth is the LORD's.

009:030 But as for thee and thy servants, I know that ye will not yet
        fear the LORD God.

009:031 And the flax and the barley was smitten: for the barley was in
        the ear, and the flax was bolled.

009:032 But the wheat and the rie were not smitten: for they were not
        grown up.

009:033 And Moses went out of the city from Pharaoh, and spread abroad
        his hands unto the LORD: and the thunders and hail ceased, and
        the rain was not poured upon the earth.

009:034 And when Pharaoh saw that the rain and the hail and the
        thunders were ceased, he sinned yet more, and hardened his
        heart, he and his servants.

009:035 And the heart of Pharaoh was hardened, neither would he let
        the children of Israel go; as the LORD had spoken by Moses.

010:001 And the LORD said unto Moses, Go in unto Pharaoh: for I have
        hardened his heart, and the heart of his servants, that I
        might shew these my signs before him:

010:002 And that thou mayest tell in the ears of thy son, and of thy
        son's son, what things I have wrought in Egypt, and my signs
        which I have done among them; that ye may know how that I am
        the LORD.

010:003 And Moses and Aaron came in unto Pharaoh, and said unto him,
        Thus saith the LORD God of the Hebrews, How long wilt thou
        refuse to humble thyself before me? let my people go, that
        they may serve me.

010:004 Else, if thou refuse to let my people go, behold, to morrow
        will I bring the locusts into thy coast:

010:005 And they shall cover the face of the earth, that one cannot be
        able to see the earth: and they shall eat the residue of that
        which is escaped, which remaineth unto you from the hail, and
        shall eat every tree which groweth for you out of the field:

010:006 And they shall fill thy houses, and the houses of all thy
        servants, and the houses of all the Egyptians; which neither
        thy fathers, nor thy fathers' fathers have seen, since the day
        that they were upon the earth unto this day. And he turned
        himself, and went out from Pharaoh.

010:007 And Pharaoh's servants said unto him, How long shall this man
        be a snare unto us? let the men go, that they may serve the
        LORD their God: knowest thou not yet that Egypt is destroyed?

010:008 And Moses and Aaron were brought again unto Pharaoh: and he
        said unto them, Go, serve the LORD your God: but who are they
        that shall go?

010:009 And Moses said, We will go with our young and with our old,
        with our sons and with our daughters, with our flocks and with
        our herds will we go; for we must hold a feast unto the LORD.

010:010 And he said unto them, Let the LORD be so with you, as I will
        let you go, and your little ones: look to it; for evil is
        before you.

010:011 Not so: go now ye that are men, and serve the LORD; for that
        ye did desire. And they were driven out from Pharaoh's
        presence.

010:012 And the LORD said unto Moses, Stretch out thine hand over the
        land of Egypt for the locusts, that they may come up upon the
        land of Egypt, and eat every herb of the land, even all that
        the hail hath left.

010:013 And Moses stretched forth his rod over the land of Egypt, and
        the LORD brought an east wind upon the land all that day, and
        all that night; and when it was morning, the east wind brought
        the locusts.

010:014 And the locust went up over all the land of Egypt, and rested
        in all the coasts of Egypt: very grievous were they; before
        them there were no such locusts as they, neither after them
        shall be such.

010:015 For they covered the face of the whole earth, so that the land
        was darkened; and they did eat every herb of the land, and all
        the fruit of the trees which the hail had left: and there
        remained not any green thing in the trees, or in the herbs of
        the field, through all the land of Egypt.

010:016 Then Pharaoh called for Moses and Aaron in haste; and he said,
        I have sinned against the LORD your God, and against you.

010:017 Now therefore forgive, I pray thee, my sin only this once, and
        intreat the LORD your God, that he may take away from me this
        death only.

010:018 And he went out from Pharaoh, and intreated the LORD.

010:019 And the LORD turned a mighty strong west wind, which took away
        the locusts, and cast them into the Red sea; there remained
        not one locust in all the coasts of Egypt.

010:020 But the LORD hardened Pharaoh's heart, so that he would not
        let the children of Israel go.

010:021 And the LORD said unto Moses, Stretch out thine hand toward
        heaven, that there may be darkness over the land of Egypt,
        even darkness which may be felt.

010:022 And Moses stretched forth his hand toward heaven; and there
        was a thick darkness in all the land of Egypt three days:

010:023 They saw not one another, neither rose any from his place for
        three days: but all the children of Israel had light in their
        dwellings.

010:024 And Pharaoh called unto Moses, and said, Go ye, serve the
        LORD; only let your flocks and your herds be stayed: let your
        little ones also go with you.

010:025 And Moses said, Thou must give us also sacrifices and burnt
        offerings, that we may sacrifice unto the LORD our God.

010:026 Our cattle also shall go with us; there shall not an hoof be
        left behind; for thereof must we take to serve the LORD our
        God; and we know not with what we must serve the LORD, until
        we come thither.

010:027 But the LORD hardened Pharaoh's heart, and he would not let
        them go.

010:028 And Pharaoh said unto him, Get thee from me, take heed to
        thyself, see my face no more; for in that day thou seest my
        face thou shalt die.

010:029 And Moses said, Thou hast spoken well, I will see thy face
        again no more.

011:001 And the LORD said unto Moses, Yet will I bring one plague more
        upon Pharaoh, and upon Egypt; afterwards he will let you go
        hence: when he shall let you go, he shall surely thrust you
        out hence altogether.

011:002 Speak now in the ears of the people, and let every man borrow
        of his neighbour, and every woman of her neighbour, jewels of
        silver and jewels of gold.

011:003 And the LORD gave the people favour in the sight of the
        Egyptians. Moreover the man Moses was very great in the land
        of Egypt, in the sight of Pharaoh's servants, and in the sight
        of the people.

011:004 And Moses said, Thus saith the LORD, About midnight will I go
        out into the midst of Egypt:

011:005 And all the firstborn in the land of Egypt shall die, from the
        first born of Pharaoh that sitteth upon his throne, even unto
        the firstborn of the maidservant that is behind the mill; and
        all the firstborn of beasts.

011:006 And there shall be a great cry throughout all the land of
        Egypt, such as there was none like it, nor shall be like it
        any more.

011:007 But against any of the children of Israel shall not a dog move
        his tongue, against man or beast: that ye may know how that
        the LORD doth put a difference between the Egyptians and
        Israel.

011:008 And all these thy servants shall come down unto me, and bow
        down themselves unto me, saying, Get thee out, and all the
        people that follow thee: and after that I will go out. And he
        went out from Pharaoh in a great anger.

011:009 And the LORD said unto Moses, Pharaoh shall not hearken unto
        you; that my wonders may be multiplied in the land of Egypt.

011:010 And Moses and Aaron did all these wonders before Pharaoh: and
        the LORD hardened Pharaoh's heart, so that he would not let
        the children of Israel go out of his land.

012:001 And the LORD spake unto Moses and Aaron in the land of Egypt
        saying,

012:002 This month shall be unto you the beginning of months: it shall
        be the first month of the year to you.

012:003 Speak ye unto all the congregation of Israel, saying, In the
        tenth day of this month they shall take to them every man a
        lamb, according to the house of their fathers, a lamb for an
        house:

012:004 And if the household be too little for the lamb, let him and
        his neighbour next unto his house take it according to the
        number of the souls; every man according to his eating shall
        make your count for the lamb.

012:005 Your lamb shall be without blemish, a male of the first year:
        ye shall take it out from the sheep, or from the goats:

012:006 And ye shall keep it up until the fourteenth day of the same
        month: and the whole assembly of the congregation of Israel
        shall kill it in the evening.

012:007 And they shall take of the blood, and strike it on the two
        side posts and on the upper door post of the houses, wherein
        they shall eat it.

012:008 And they shall eat the flesh in that night, roast with fire,
        and unleavened bread; and with bitter herbs they shall eat it.

012:009 Eat not of it raw, nor sodden at all with water, but roast
        with fire; his head with his legs, and with the purtenance
        thereof.

012:010 And ye shall let nothing of it remain until the morning; and
        that which remaineth of it until the morning ye shall burn
        with fire.

012:011 And thus shall ye eat it; with your loins girded, your shoes
        on your feet, and your staff in your hand; and ye shall eat it
        in haste: it is the LORD's passover.

012:012 For I will pass through the land of Egypt this night, and will
        smite all the firstborn in the land of Egypt, both man and
        beast; and against all the gods of Egypt I will execute
        judgment: I am the LORD.

012:013 And the blood shall be to you for a token upon the houses
        where ye are: and when I see the blood, I will pass over you,
        and the plague shall not be upon you to destroy you, when I
        smite the land of Egypt.

012:014 And this day shall be unto you for a memorial; and ye shall
        keep it a feast to the LORD throughout your generations; ye
        shall keep it a feast by an ordinance for ever.

012:015 Seven days shall ye eat unleavened bread; even the first day
        ye shall put away leaven out of your houses: for whosoever
        eateth leavened bread from the first day until the seventh
        day, that soul shall be cut off from Israel.

012:016 And in the first day there shall be an holy convocation, and
        in the seventh day there shall be an holy convocation to you;
        no manner of work shall be done in them, save that which every
        man must eat, that only may be done of you.

012:017 And ye shall observe the feast of unleavened bread; for in
        this selfsame day have I brought your armies out of the land
        of Egypt: therefore shall ye observe this day in your
        generations by an ordinance for ever.

012:018 In the first month, on the fourteenth day of the month at
        even, ye shall eat unleavened bread, until the one and
        twentieth day of the month at even.

012:019 Seven days shall there be no leaven found in your houses: for
        whosoever eateth that which is leavened, even that soul shall
        be cut off from the congregation of Israel, whether he be a
        stranger, or born in the land.

012:020 Ye shall eat nothing leavened; in all your habitations shall
        ye eat unleavened bread.

012:021 Then Moses called for all the elders of Israel, and said unto
        them, Draw out and take you a lamb according to your families,
        and kill the passover.

012:022 And ye shall take a bunch of hyssop, and dip it in the blood
        that is in the bason, and strike the lintel and the two side
        posts with the blood that is in the bason; and none of you
        shall go out at the door of his house until the morning.

012:023 For the LORD will pass through to smite the Egyptians; and
        when he seeth the blood upon the lintel, and on the two side
        posts, the LORD will pass over the door, and will not suffer
        the destroyer to come in unto your houses to smite you.

012:024 And ye shall observe this thing for an ordinance to thee and
        to thy sons for ever.

012:025 And it shall come to pass, when ye be come to the land which
        the LORD will give you, according as he hath promised, that ye
        shall keep this service.

012:026 And it shall come to pass, when your children shall say unto
        you, What mean ye by this service?

012:027 That ye shall say, It is the sacrifice of the LORD's passover,
        who passed over the houses of the children of Israel in Egypt,
        when he smote the Egyptians, and delivered our houses. And the
        people bowed the head and worshipped.

012:028 And the children of Israel went away, and did as the LORD had
        commanded Moses and Aaron, so did they.

012:029 And it came to pass, that at midnight the LORD smote all the
        firstborn in the land of Egypt, from the firstborn of Pharaoh
        that sat on his throne unto the firstborn of the captive that
        was in the dungeon; and all the firstborn of cattle.

012:030 And Pharaoh rose up in the night, he, and all his servants,
        and all the Egyptians; and there was a great cry in Egypt; for
        there was not a house where there was not one dead.

012:031 And he called for Moses and Aaron by night, and said, Rise up,
        and get you forth from among my people, both ye and the
        children of Israel; and go, serve the LORD, as ye have said.

012:032 Also take your flocks and your herds, as ye have said, and be
        gone; and bless me also.

012:033 And the Egyptians were urgent upon the people, that they might
        send them out of the land in haste; for they said, We be all
        dead men.

012:034 And the people took their dough before it was leavened, their
        kneadingtroughs being bound up in their clothes upon their
        shoulders.

012:035 And the children of Israel did according to the word of Moses;
        and they borrowed of the Egyptians jewels of silver, and
        jewels of gold, and raiment:

012:036 And the LORD gave the people favour in the sight of the
        Egyptians, so that they lent unto them such things as they
        required. And they spoiled the Egyptians.

012:037 And the children of Israel journeyed from Rameses to Succoth,
        about six hundred thousand on foot that were men, beside
        children.

012:038 And a mixed multitude went up also with them; and flocks, and
        herds, even very much cattle.

012:039 And they baked unleavened cakes of the dough which they
        brought forth out of Egypt, for it was not leavened; because
        they were thrust out of Egypt, and could not tarry, neither
        had they prepared for themselves any victual.

012:040 Now the sojourning of the children of Israel, who dwelt in
        Egypt, was four hundred and thirty years.

012:041 And it came to pass at the end of the four hundred and thirty
        years, even the selfsame day it came to pass, that all the
        hosts of the LORD went out from the land of Egypt.

012:042 It is a night to be much observed unto the LORD for bringing
        them out from the land of Egypt: this is that night of the
        LORD to be observed of all the children of Israel in their
        generations.

012:043 And the LORD said unto Moses and Aaron, This is the ordinance
        of the passover: There shall no stranger eat thereof:

012:044 But every man's servant that is bought for money, when thou
        hast circumcised him, then shall he eat thereof.

012:045 A foreigner and an hired servant shall not eat thereof.

012:046 In one house shall it be eaten; thou shalt not carry forth
        ought of the flesh abroad out of the house; neither shall ye
        break a bone thereof.

012:047 All the congregation of Israel shall keep it.

012:048 And when a stranger shall sojourn with thee, and will keep the
        passover to the LORD, let all his males be circumcised, and
        then let him come near and keep it; and he shall be as one
        that is born in the land: for no uncircumcised person shall
        eat thereof.

012:049 One law shall be to him that is homeborn, and unto the
        stranger that sojourneth among you.

012:050 Thus did all the children of Israel; as the LORD commanded
        Moses and Aaron, so did they.

012:051 And it came to pass the selfsame day, that the LORD did bring
        the children of Israel out of the land of Egypt by their
        armies.

013:001 And the LORD spake unto Moses, saying,

013:002 Sanctify unto me all the firstborn, whatsoever openeth the
        womb among the children of Israel, both of man and of beast:
        it is mine.

013:003 And Moses said unto the people, Remember this day, in which ye
        came out from Egypt, out of the house of bondage; for by
        strength of hand the LORD brought you out from this place:
        there shall no leavened bread be eaten.

013:004 This day came ye out in the month Abib.

013:005 And it shall be when the LORD shall bring thee into the land
        of the Canaanites, and the Hittites, and the Amorites, and the
        Hivites, and the Jebusites, which he sware unto thy fathers to
        give thee, a land flowing with milk and honey, that thou shalt
        keep this service in this month.

013:006 Seven days thou shalt eat unleavened bread, and in the seventh
        day shall be a feast to the LORD.

013:007 Unleavened bread shall be eaten seven days; and there shall no
        leavened bread be seen with thee, neither shall there be
        leaven seen with thee in all thy quarters.

013:008 And thou shalt shew thy son in that day, saying, This is done
        because of that which the LORD did unto me when I came forth
        out of Egypt.

013:009 And it shall be for a sign unto thee upon thine hand, and for
        a memorial between thine eyes, that the LORD's law may be in
        thy mouth: for with a strong hand hath the LORD brought thee
        out of Egypt.

013:010 Thou shalt therefore keep this ordinance in his season from
        year to year.

013:011 And it shall be when the LORD shall bring thee into the land
        of the Canaanites, as he sware unto thee and to thy fathers,
        and shall give it thee,

013:012 That thou shalt set apart unto the LORD all that openeth the
        matrix, and every firstling that cometh of a beast which thou
        hast; the males shall be the LORD's.

013:013 And every firstling of an ass thou shalt redeem with a lamb;
        and if thou wilt not redeem it, then thou shalt break his
        neck: and all the firstborn of man among thy children shalt
        thou redeem.

013:014 And it shall be when thy son asketh thee in time to come,
        saying, What is this? that thou shalt say unto him, By
        strength of hand the LORD brought us out from Egypt, from the
        house of bondage:

013:015 And it came to pass, when Pharaoh would hardly let us go, that
        the LORD slew all the firstborn in the land of Egypt, both the
        firstborn of man, and the firstborn of beast: therefore I
        sacrifice to the LORD all that openeth the matrix, being
        males; but all the firstborn of my children I redeem.

013:016 And it shall be for a token upon thine hand, and for frontlets
        between thine eyes: for by strength of hand the LORD brought
        us forth out of Egypt.

013:017 And it came to pass, when Pharaoh had let the people go, that
        God led them not through the way of the land of the
        Philistines, although that was near; for God said, Lest
        peradventure the people repent when they see war, and they
        return to Egypt:

013:018 But God led the people about, through the way of the
        wilderness of the Red sea: and the children of Israel went up
        harnessed out of the land of Egypt.

013:019 And Moses took the bones of Joseph with him: for he had
        straitly sworn the children of Israel, saying, God will surely
        visit you; and ye shall carry up my bones away hence with you.

013:020 And they took their journey from Succoth, and encamped in
        Etham, in the edge of the wilderness.

013:021 And the LORD went before them by day in a pillar of a cloud,
        to lead them the way; and by night in a pillar of fire, to
        give them light; to go by day and night:

013:022 He took not away the pillar of the cloud by day, nor the
        pillar of fire by night, from before the people.

014:001 And the LORD spake unto Moses, saying,

014:002 Speak unto the children of Israel, that they turn and encamp
        before Pihahiroth, between Migdol and the sea, over against
        Baalzephon: before it shall ye encamp by the sea.

014:003 For Pharaoh will say of the children of Israel, They are
        entangled in the land, the wilderness hath shut them in.

014:004 And I will harden Pharaoh's heart, that he shall follow after
        them; and I will be honoured upon Pharaoh, and upon all his
        host; that the Egyptians may know that I am the LORD. And they
        did so.

014:005 And it was told the king of Egypt that the people fled: and
        the heart of Pharaoh and of his servants was turned against
        the people, and they said, Why have we done this, that we have
        let Israel go from serving us?

014:006 And he made ready his chariot, and took his people with him:

014:007 And he took six hundred chosen chariots, and all the chariots
        of Egypt, and captains over every one of them.

014:008 And the LORD hardened the heart of Pharaoh king of Egypt, and
        he pursued after the children of Israel: and the children of
        Israel went out with an high hand.

014:009 But the Egyptians pursued after them, all the horses and
        chariots of Pharaoh, and his horsemen, and his army, and
        overtook them encamping by the sea, beside Pihahiroth, before
        Baalzephon.

014:010 And when Pharaoh drew nigh, the children of Israel lifted up
        their eyes, and, behold, the Egyptians marched after them; and
        they were sore afraid: and the children of Israel cried out
        unto the LORD.

014:011 And they said unto Moses, Because there were no graves in
        Egypt, hast thou taken us away to die in the wilderness?
        wherefore hast thou dealt thus with us, to carry us forth out
        of Egypt?

014:012 Is not this the word that we did tell thee in Egypt, saying,
        Let us alone, that we may serve the Egyptians? For it had been
        better for us to serve the Egyptians, than that we should die
        in the wilderness.

014:013 And Moses said unto the people, Fear ye not, stand still, and
        see the salvation of the LORD, which he will shew to you to
        day: for the Egyptians whom ye have seen to day, ye shall see
        them again no more for ever.

014:014 The LORD shall fight for you, and ye shall hold your peace.

014:015 And the LORD said unto Moses, Wherefore criest thou unto me?
        speak unto the children of Israel, that they go forward:

014:016 But lift thou up thy rod, and stretch out thine hand over the
        sea, and divide it: and the children of Israel shall go on dry
        ground through the midst of the sea.

014:017 And I, behold, I will harden the hearts of the Egyptians, and
        they shall follow them: and I will get me honour upon Pharaoh,
        and upon all his host, upon his chariots, and upon his
        horsemen.

014:018 And the Egyptians shall know that I am the LORD, when I have
        gotten me honour upon Pharaoh, upon his chariots, and upon his
        horsemen.

014:019 And the angel of God, which went before the camp of Israel,
        removed and went behind them; and the pillar of the cloud went
        from before their face, and stood behind them:

014:020 And it came between the camp of the Egyptians and the camp of
        Israel; and it was a cloud and darkness to them, but it gave
        light by night to these: so that the one came not near the
        other all the night.

014:021 And Moses stretched out his hand over the sea; and the LORD
        caused the sea to go back by a strong east wind all that
        night, and made the sea dry land, and the waters were divided.

014:022 And the children of Israel went into the midst of the sea upon
        the dry ground: and the waters were a wall unto them on their
        right hand, and on their left.

014:023 And the Egyptians pursued, and went in after them to the midst
        of the sea, even all Pharaoh's horses, his chariots, and his
        horsemen.

014:024 And it came to pass, that in the morning watch the LORD looked
        unto the host of the Egyptians through the pillar of fire and
        of the cloud, and troubled the host of the Egyptians,

014:025 And took off their chariot wheels, that they drave them
        heavily: so that the Egyptians said, Let us flee from the face
        of Israel; for the LORD fighteth for them against the
        Egyptians.

014:026 And the LORD said unto Moses, Stretch out thine hand over the
        sea, that the waters may come again upon the Egyptians, upon
        their chariots, and upon their horsemen.

014:027 And Moses stretched forth his hand over the sea, and the sea
        returned to his strength when the morning appeared; and the
        Egyptians fled against it; and the LORD overthrew the
        Egyptians in the midst of the sea.

014:028 And the waters returned, and covered the chariots, and the
        horsemen, and all the host of Pharaoh that came into the sea
        after them; there remained not so much as one of them.

014:029 But the children of Israel walked upon dry land in the midst
        of the sea; and the waters were a wall unto them on their
        right hand, and on their left.

014:030 Thus the LORD saved Israel that day out of the hand of the
        Egyptians; and Israel saw the Egyptians dead upon the sea
        shore.

014:031 And Israel saw that great work which the LORD did upon the
        Egyptians: and the people feared the LORD, and believed the
        LORD, and his servant Moses.

015:001 Then sang Moses and the children of Israel this song unto the
        LORD, and spake, saying, I will sing unto the LORD, for he
        hath triumphed gloriously: the horse and his rider hath he
        thrown into the sea.

015:002 The LORD is my strength and song, and he is become my
        salvation: he is my God, and I will prepare him an habitation;
        my father's God, and I will exalt him.

015:003 The LORD is a man of war: the LORD is his name.

015:004 Pharaoh's chariots and his host hath he cast into the sea: his
        chosen captains also are drowned in the Red sea.

015:005 The depths have covered them: they sank into the bottom as a
        stone.

015:006 Thy right hand, O LORD, is become glorious in power: thy right
        hand, O LORD, hath dashed in pieces the enemy.

015:007 And in the greatness of thine excellency thou hast overthrown
        them that rose up against thee: thou sentest forth thy wrath,
        which consumed them as stubble.

015:008 And with the blast of thy nostrils the waters were gathered
        together, the floods stood upright as an heap, and the depths
        were congealed in the heart of the sea.

015:009 The enemy said, I will pursue, I will overtake, I will divide
        the spoil; my lust shall be satisfied upon them; I will draw
        my sword, my hand shall destroy them.

015:010 Thou didst blow with thy wind, the sea covered them: they sank
        as lead in the mighty waters.

015:011 Who is like unto thee, O LORD, among the gods? who is like
        thee, glorious in holiness, fearful in praises, doing wonders?

015:012 Thou stretchedst out thy right hand, the earth swallowed them.

015:013 Thou in thy mercy hast led forth the people which thou hast
        redeemed: thou hast guided them in thy strength unto thy holy
        habitation.

015:014 The people shall hear, and be afraid: sorrow shall take hold
        on the inhabitants of Palestina.

015:015 Then the dukes of Edom shall be amazed; the mighty men of
        Moab, trembling shall take hold upon them; all the inhabitants
        of Canaan shall melt away.

015:016 Fear and dread shall fall upon them; by the greatness of thine
        arm they shall be as still as a stone; till thy people pass
        over, O LORD, till the people pass over, which thou hast
        purchased.

015:017 Thou shalt bring them in, and plant them in the mountain of
        thine inheritance, in the place, O LORD, which thou hast made
        for thee to dwell in, in the Sanctuary, O LORD, which thy
        hands have established.

015:018 The LORD shall reign for ever and ever.

015:019 For the horse of Pharaoh went in with his chariots and with
        his horsemen into the sea, and the LORD brought again the
        waters of the sea upon them; but the children of Israel went
        on dry land in the midst of the sea.

015:020 And Miriam the prophetess, the sister of Aaron, took a timbrel
        in her hand; and all the women went out after her with
        timbrels and with dances.

015:021 And Miriam answered them, Sing ye to the LORD, for he hath
        triumphed gloriously; the horse and his rider hath he thrown
        into the sea.

015:022 So Moses brought Israel from the Red sea, and they went out
        into the wilderness of Shur; and they went three days in the
        wilderness, and found no water.

015:023 And when they came to Marah, they could not drink of the
        waters of Marah, for they were bitter: therefore the name of
        it was called Marah.

015:024 And the people murmured against Moses, saying, What shall we
        drink?

015:025 And he cried unto the LORD; and the LORD shewed him a tree,
        which when he had cast into the waters, the waters were made
        sweet: there he made for them a statute and an ordinance, and
        there he proved them,

015:026 And said, If thou wilt diligently hearken to the voice of the
        LORD thy God, and wilt do that which is right in his sight,
        and wilt give ear to his commandments, and keep all his
        statutes, I will put none of these diseases upon thee, which I
        have brought upon the Egyptians: for I am the LORD that
        healeth thee.

015:027 And they came to Elim, where were twelve wells of water, and
        threescore and ten palm trees: and they encamped there by the
        waters.

016:001 And they took their journey from Elim, and all the
        congregation of the children of Israel came unto the
        wilderness of Sin, which is between Elim and Sinai, on the
        fifteenth day of the second month after their departing out of
        the land of Egypt.

016:002 And the whole congregation of the children of Israel murmured
        against Moses and Aaron in the wilderness:

016:003 And the children of Israel said unto them, Would to God we had
        died by the hand of the LORD in the land of Egypt, when we sat
        by the flesh pots, and when we did eat bread to the full; for
        ye have brought us forth into this wilderness, to kill this
        whole assembly with hunger.

016:004 Then said the LORD unto Moses, Behold, I will rain bread from
        heaven for you; and the people shall go out and gather a
        certain rate every day, that I may prove them, whether they
        will walk in my law, or no.

016:005 And it shall come to pass, that on the sixth day they shall
        prepare that which they bring in; and it shall be twice as
        much as they gather daily.

016:006 And Moses and Aaron said unto all the children of Israel, At
        even, then ye shall know that the LORD hath brought you out
        from the land of Egypt:

016:007 And in the morning, then ye shall see the glory of the LORD;
        for that he heareth your murmurings against the LORD: and what
        are we, that ye murmur against us?

016:008 And Moses said, This shall be, when the LORD shall give you in
        the evening flesh to eat, and in the morning bread to the
        full; for that the LORD heareth your murmurings which ye
        murmur against him: and what are we? your murmurings are not
        against us, but against the LORD.

016:009 And Moses spake unto Aaron, Say unto all the congregation of
        the children of Israel, Come near before the LORD: for he hath
        heard your murmurings.

016:010 And it came to pass, as Aaron spake unto the whole
        congregation of the children of Israel, that they looked
        toward the wilderness, and, behold, the glory of the LORD
        appeared in the cloud.

016:011 And the LORD spake unto Moses, saying,

016:012 I have heard the murmurings of the children of Israel: speak
        unto them, saying, At even ye shall eat flesh, and in the
        morning ye shall be filled with bread; and ye shall know that
        I am the LORD your God.

016:013 And it came to pass, that at even the quails came up, and
        covered the camp: and in the morning the dew lay round about
        the host.

016:014 And when the dew that lay was gone up, behold, upon the face
        of the wilderness there lay a small round thing, as small as
        the hoar frost on the ground.

016:015 And when the children of Israel saw it, they said one to
        another, It is manna: for they wist not what it was. And Moses
        said unto them, This is the bread which the LORD hath given
        you to eat.

016:016 This is the thing which the LORD hath commanded, Gather of it
        every man according to his eating, an omer for every man,
        according to the number of your persons; take ye every man for
        them which are in his tents.

016:017 And the children of Israel did so, and gathered, some more,
        some less.

016:018 And when they did mete it with an omer, he that gathered much
        had nothing over, and he that gathered little had no lack;
        they gathered every man according to his eating.

016:019 And Moses said, Let no man leave of it till the morning.

016:020 Notwithstanding they hearkened not unto Moses; but some of
        them left of it until the morning, and it bred worms, and
        stank: and Moses was wroth with them.

016:021 And they gathered it every morning, every man according to his
        eating: and when the sun waxed hot, it melted.

016:022 And it came to pass, that on the sixth day they gathered twice
        as much bread, two omers for one man: and all the rulers of
        the congregation came and told Moses.

016:023 And he said unto them, This is that which the LORD hath said,
        To morrow is the rest of the holy sabbath unto the LORD: bake
        that which ye will bake to day, and seethe that ye will
        seethe; and that which remaineth over lay up for you to be
        kept until the morning.

016:024 And they laid it up till the morning, as Moses bade: and it
        did not stink, neither was there any worm therein.

016:025 And Moses said, Eat that to day; for to day is a sabbath unto
        the LORD: to day ye shall not find it in the field.

016:026 Six days ye shall gather it; but on the seventh day, which is
        the sabbath, in it there shall be none.

016:027 And it came to pass, that there went out some of the people on
        the seventh day for to gather, and they found none.

016:028 And the LORD said unto Moses, How long refuse ye to keep my
        commandments and my laws?

016:029 See, for that the LORD hath given you the sabbath, therefore
        he giveth you on the sixth day the bread of two days; abide ye
        every man in his place, let no man go out of his place on the
        seventh day.

016:030 So the people rested on the seventh day.

016:031 And the house of Israel called the name thereof Manna: and it
        was like coriander seed, white; and the taste of it was like
        wafers made with honey.

016:032 And Moses said, This is the thing which the LORD commandeth,
        Fill an omer of it to be kept for your generations; that they
        may see the bread wherewith I have fed you in the wilderness,
        when I brought you forth from the land of Egypt.

016:033 And Moses said unto Aaron, Take a pot, and put an omer full of
        manna therein, and lay it up before the LORD, to be kept for
        your generations.

016:034 As the LORD commanded Moses, so Aaron laid it up before the
        Testimony, to be kept.

016:035 And the children of Israel did eat manna forty years, until
        they came to a land inhabited; they did eat manna, until they
        came unto the borders of the land of Canaan.

016:036 Now an omer is the tenth part of an ephah.

017:001 And all the congregation of the children of Israel journeyed
        from the wilderness of Sin, after their journeys, according to
        the commandment of the LORD, and pitched in Rephidim: and
        there was no water for the people to drink.

017:002 Wherefore the people did chide with Moses, and said, Give us
        water that we may drink. And Moses said unto them, Why chide
        ye with me? wherefore do ye tempt the LORD?

017:003 And the people thirsted there for water; and the people
        murmured against Moses, and said, Wherefore is this that thou
        hast brought us up out of Egypt, to kill us and our children
        and our cattle with thirst?

017:004 And Moses cried unto the LORD, saying, What shall I do unto
        this people? they be almost ready to stone me.

017:005 And the LORD said unto Moses, Go on before the people, and
        take with thee of the elders of Israel; and thy rod, wherewith
        thou smotest the river, take in thine hand, and go.

017:006 Behold, I will stand before thee there upon the rock in Horeb;
        and thou shalt smite the rock, and there shall come water out
        of it, that the people may drink. And Moses did so in the
        sight of the elders of Israel.

017:007 And he called the name of the place Massah, and Meribah,
        because of the chiding of the children of Israel, and because
        they tempted the LORD, saying, Is the LORD among us, or not?

017:008 Then came Amalek, and fought with Israel in Rephidim.

017:009 And Moses said unto Joshua, Choose us out men, and go out,
        fight with Amalek: to morrow I will stand on the top of the
        hill with the rod of God in mine hand.

017:010 So Joshua did as Moses had said to him, and fought with
        Amalek: and Moses, Aaron, and Hur went up to the top of the
        hill.

017:011 And it came to pass, when Moses held up his hand, that Israel
        prevailed: and when he let down his hand, Amalek prevailed.

017:012 But Moses hands were heavy; and they took a stone, and put it
        under him, and he sat thereon; and Aaron and Hur stayed up his
        hands, the one on the one side, and the other on the other
        side; and his hands were steady until the going down of the
        sun.

017:013 And Joshua discomfited Amalek and his people with the edge of
        the sword.

017:014 And the LORD said unto Moses, Write this for a memorial in a
        book, and rehearse it in the ears of Joshua: for I will
        utterly put out the remembrance of Amalek from under heaven.

017:015 And Moses built an altar, and called the name of it
        Jehovahnissi:

017:016 For he said, Because the LORD hath sworn that the LORD will
        have war with Amalek from generation to generation.

018:001 When Jethro, the priest of Midian, Moses' father in law, heard
        of all that God had done for Moses, and for Israel his people,
        and that the LORD had brought Israel out of Egypt;

018:002 Then Jethro, Moses' father in law, took Zipporah, Moses' wife,
        after he had sent her back,

018:003 And her two sons; of which the name of the one was Gershom;
        for he said, I have been an alien in a strange land:

018:004 And the name of the other was Eliezer; for the God of my
        father, said he, was mine help, and delivered me from the
        sword of Pharaoh:

018:005 And Jethro, Moses' father in law, came with his sons and his
        wife unto Moses into the wilderness, where he encamped at the
        mount of God:

018:006 And he said unto Moses, I thy father in law Jethro am come
        unto thee, and thy wife, and her two sons with her.

018:007 And Moses went out to meet his father in law, and did
        obeisance, and kissed him; and they asked each other of their
        welfare; and they came into the tent.

018:008 And Moses told his father in law all that the LORD had done
        unto Pharaoh and to the Egyptians for Israel's sake, and all
        the travail that had come upon them by the way, and how the
        LORD delivered them.

018:009 And Jethro rejoiced for all the goodness which the LORD had
        done to Israel, whom he had delivered out of the hand of the
        Egyptians.

018:010 And Jethro said, Blessed be the LORD, who hath delivered you
        out of the hand of the Egyptians, and out of the hand of
        Pharaoh, who hath delivered the people from under the hand of
        the Egyptians.

018:011 Now I know that the LORD is greater than all gods: for in the
        thing wherein they dealt proudly he was above them.

018:012 And Jethro, Moses' father in law, took a burnt offering and
        sacrifices for God: and Aaron came, and all the elders of
        Israel, to eat bread with Moses' father in law before God.

018:013 And it came to pass on the morrow, that Moses sat to judge the
        people: and the people stood by Moses from the morning unto
        the evening.

018:014 And when Moses' father in law saw all that he did to the
        people, he said, What is this thing that thou doest to the
        people? why sittest thou thyself alone, and all the people
        stand by thee from morning unto even?

018:015 And Moses said unto his father in law, Because the people come
        unto me to enquire of God:

018:016 When they have a matter, they come unto me; and I judge
        between one and another, and I do make them know the statutes
        of God, and his laws.

018:017 And Moses' father in law said unto him, The thing that thou
        doest is not good.

018:018 Thou wilt surely wear away, both thou, and this people that is
        with thee: for this thing is too heavy for thee; thou art not
        able to perform it thyself alone.

018:019 Hearken now unto my voice, I will give thee counsel, and God
        shall be with thee: Be thou for the people to God-ward, that
        thou mayest bring the causes unto God:

018:020 And thou shalt teach them ordinances and laws, and shalt shew
        them the way wherein they must walk, and the work that they
        must do.

018:021 Moreover thou shalt provide out of all the people able men,
        such as fear God, men of truth, hating covetousness; and place
        such over them, to be rulers of thousands, and rulers of
        hundreds, rulers of fifties, and rulers of tens:

018:022 And let them judge the people at all seasons: and it shall be,
        that every great matter they shall bring unto thee, but every
        small matter they shall judge: so shall it be easier for
        thyself, and they shall bear the burden with thee.

018:023 If thou shalt do this thing, and God command thee so, then
        thou shalt be able to endure, and all this people shall also
        go to their place in peace.

018:024 So Moses hearkened to the voice of his father in law, and did
        all that he had said.

018:025 And Moses chose able men out of all Israel, and made them
        heads over the people, rulers of thousands, rulers of
        hundreds, rulers of fifties, and rulers of tens.

018:026 And they judged the people at all seasons: the hard causes
        they brought unto Moses, but every small matter they judged
        themselves.

018:027 And Moses let his father in law depart; and he went his way
        into his own land.

019:001 In the third month, when the children of Israel were gone
        forth out of the land of Egypt, the same day came they into
        the wilderness of Sinai.

019:002 For they were departed from Rephidim, and were come to the
        desert of Sinai, and had pitched in the wilderness; and there
        Israel camped before the mount.

019:003 And Moses went up unto God, and the LORD called unto him out
        of the mountain, saying, Thus shalt thou say to the house of
        Jacob, and tell the children of Israel;

019:004 Ye have seen what I did unto the Egyptians, and how I bare you
        on eagles' wings, and brought you unto myself.

019:005 Now therefore, if ye will obey my voice indeed, and keep my
        covenant, then ye shall be a peculiar treasure unto me above
        all people: for all the earth is mine:

019:006 And ye shall be unto me a kingdom of priests, and an holy
        nation. These are the words which thou shalt speak unto the
        children of Israel.

019:007 And Moses came and called for the elders of the people, and
        laid before their faces all these words which the LORD
        commanded him.

019:008 And all the people answered together, and said, All that the
        LORD hath spoken we will do. And Moses returned the words of
        the people unto the LORD.

019:009 And the LORD said unto Moses, Lo, I come unto thee in a thick
        cloud, that the people may hear when I speak with thee, and
        believe thee for ever. And Moses told the words of the people
        unto the LORD.

019:010 And the LORD said unto Moses, Go unto the people, and sanctify
        them to day and to morrow, and let them wash their clothes,

019:011 And be ready against the third day: for the third day the LORD
        will come down in the sight of all the people upon mount
        Sinai.

019:012 And thou shalt set bounds unto the people round about, saying,
        Take heed to yourselves, that ye go not up into the mount, or
        touch the border of it: whosoever toucheth the mount shall be
        surely put to death:

019:013 There shall not an hand touch it, but he shall surely be
        stoned, or shot through; whether it be beast or man, it shall
        not live: when the trumpet soundeth long, they shall come up
        to the mount.

019:014 And Moses went down from the mount unto the people, and
        sanctified the people; and they washed their clothes.

019:015 And he said unto the people, Be ready against the third day:
        come not at your wives.

019:016 And it came to pass on the third day in the morning, that
        there were thunders and lightnings, and a thick cloud upon the
        mount, and the voice of the trumpet exceeding loud; so that
        all the people that was in the camp trembled.

019:017 And Moses brought forth the people out of the camp to meet
        with God; and they stood at the nether part of the mount.

019:018 And mount Sinai was altogether on a smoke, because the LORD
        descended upon it in fire: and the smoke thereof ascended as
        the smoke of a furnace, and the whole mount quaked greatly.

019:019 And when the voice of the trumpet sounded long, and waxed
        louder and louder, Moses spake, and God answered him by a
        voice.

019:020 And the LORD came down upon mount Sinai, on the top of the
        mount: and the LORD called Moses up to the top of the mount;
        and Moses went up.

019:021 And the LORD said unto Moses, Go down, charge the people, lest
        they break through unto the LORD to gaze, and many of them
        perish.

019:022 And let the priests also, which come near to the LORD,
        sanctify themselves, lest the LORD break forth upon them.

019:023 And Moses said unto the LORD, The people cannot come up to
        mount Sinai: for thou chargedst us, saying, Set bounds about
        the mount, and sanctify it.

019:024 And the LORD said unto him, Away, get thee down, and thou
        shalt come up, thou, and Aaron with thee: but let not the
        priests and the people break through to come up unto the LORD,
        lest he break forth upon them.

019:025 So Moses went down unto the people, and spake unto them.

020:001 And God spake all these words, saying,

020:002 I am the LORD thy God, which have brought thee out of the land
        of Egypt, out of the house of bondage.

020:003 Thou shalt have no other gods before me.

020:004 Thou shalt not make unto thee any graven image, or any
        likeness of any thing that is in heaven above, or that is in
        the earth beneath, or that is in the water under the earth.

020:005 Thou shalt not bow down thyself to them, nor serve them: for I
        the LORD thy God am a jealous God, visiting the iniquity of
        the fathers upon the children unto the third and fourth
        generation of them that hate me;

020:006 And shewing mercy unto thousands of them that love me, and
        keep my commandments.

020:007 Thou shalt not take the name of the LORD thy God in vain; for
        the LORD will not hold him guiltless that taketh his name in
        vain.

020:008 Remember the sabbath day, to keep it holy.

020:009 Six days shalt thou labour, and do all thy work:

020:010 But the seventh day is the sabbath of the LORD thy God: in it
        thou shalt not do any work, thou, nor thy son, nor thy
        daughter, thy manservant, nor thy maidservant, nor thy cattle,
        nor thy stranger that is within thy gates:

020:011 For in six days the LORD made heaven and earth, the sea, and
        all that in them is, and rested the seventh day: wherefore the
        LORD blessed the sabbath day, and hallowed it.

020:012 Honour thy father and thy mother: that thy days may be long
        upon the land which the LORD thy God giveth thee.

020:013 Thou shalt not kill.

020:014 Thou shalt not commit adultery.

020:015 Thou shalt not steal.

020:016 Thou shalt not bear false witness against thy neighbour.

020:017 Thou shalt not covet thy neighbour's house, thou shalt not
        covet thy neighbour's wife, nor his manservant, nor his
        maidservant, nor his ox, nor his ass, nor any thing that is
        thy neighbour's.

020:018 And all the people saw the thunderings, and the lightnings,
        and the noise of the trumpet, and the mountain smoking: and
        when the people saw it, they removed, and stood afar off.

020:019 And they said unto Moses, Speak thou with us, and we will
        hear: but let not God speak with us, lest we die.

020:020 And Moses said unto the people, Fear not: for God is come to
        prove you, and that his fear may be before your faces, that ye
        sin not.

020:021 And the people stood afar off, and Moses drew near unto the
        thick darkness where God was.

020:022 And the LORD said unto Moses, Thus thou shalt say unto the
        children of Israel, Ye have seen that I have talked with you
        from heaven.

020:023 Ye shall not make with me gods of silver, neither shall ye
        make unto you gods of gold.

020:024 An altar of earth thou shalt make unto me, and shalt sacrifice
        thereon thy burnt offerings, and thy peace offerings, thy
        sheep, and thine oxen: in all places where I record my name I
        will come unto thee, and I will bless thee.

020:025 And if thou wilt make me an altar of stone, thou shalt not
        build it of hewn stone: for if thou lift up thy tool upon it,
        thou hast polluted it.

020:026 Neither shalt thou go up by steps unto mine altar, that thy
        nakedness be not discovered thereon.

021:001 Now these are the judgments which thou shalt set before them.

021:002 If thou buy an Hebrew servant, six years he shall serve: and
        in the seventh he shall go out free for nothing.

021:003 If he came in by himself, he shall go out by himself: if he
        were married, then his wife shall go out with him.

021:004 If his master have given him a wife, and she have born him
        sons or daughters; the wife and her children shall be her
        master's, and he shall go out by himself.

021:005 And if the servant shall plainly say, I love my master, my
        wife, and my children; I will not go out free:

021:006 Then his master shall bring him unto the judges; he shall also
        bring him to the door, or unto the door post; and his master
        shall bore his ear through with an aul; and he shall serve him
        for ever.

021:007 And if a man sell his daughter to be a maidservant, she shall
        not go out as the menservants do.

021:008 If she please not her master, who hath betrothed her to
        himself, then shall he let her be redeemed: to sell her unto a
        strange nation he shall have no power, seeing he hath dealt
        deceitfully with her.

021:009 And if he have betrothed her unto his son, he shall deal with
        her after the manner of daughters.

021:010 If he take him another wife; her food, her raiment, and her
        duty of marriage, shall he not diminish.

021:011 And if he do not these three unto her, then shall she go out
        free without money.

021:012 He that smiteth a man, so that he die, shall be surely put to
        death.

021:013 And if a man lie not in wait, but God deliver him into his
        hand; then I will appoint thee a place whither he shall flee.

021:014 But if a man come presumptuously upon his neighbour, to slay
        him with guile; thou shalt take him from mine altar, that he
        may die.

021:015 And he that smiteth his father, or his mother, shall be surely
        put to death.

021:016 And he that stealeth a man, and selleth him, or if he be found
        in his hand, he shall surely be put to death.

021:017 And he that curseth his father, or his mother, shall surely be
        put to death.

021:018 And if men strive together, and one smite another with a
        stone, or with his fist, and he die not, but keepeth his bed:

021:019 If he rise again, and walk abroad upon his staff, then shall
        he that smote him be quit: only he shall pay for the loss of
        his time, and shall cause him to be thoroughly healed.

021:020 And if a man smite his servant, or his maid, with a rod, and
        he die under his hand; he shall be surely punished.

021:021 Notwithstanding, if he continue a day or two, he shall not be
        punished: for he is his money.

021:022 If men strive, and hurt a woman with child, so that her fruit
        depart from her, and yet no mischief follow: he shall be
        surely punished, according as the woman's husband will lay
        upon him; and he shall pay as the judges determine.

021:023 And if any mischief follow, then thou shalt give life for
        life,

021:024 Eye for eye, tooth for tooth, hand for hand, foot for foot,

021:025 Burning for burning, wound for wound, stripe for stripe.

021:026 And if a man smite the eye of his servant, or the eye of his
        maid, that it perish; he shall let him go free for his eye's
        sake.

021:027 And if he smite out his manservant's tooth, or his
        maidservant's tooth; he shall let him go free for his tooth's
        sake.

021:028 If an ox gore a man or a woman, that they die: then the ox
        shall be surely stoned, and his flesh shall not be eaten; but
        the owner of the ox shall be quit.

021:029 But if the ox were wont to push with his horn in time past,
        and it hath been testified to his owner, and he hath not kept
        him in, but that he hath killed a man or a woman; the ox shall
        be stoned, and his owner also shall be put to death.

021:030 If there be laid on him a sum of money, then he shall give for
        the ransom of his life whatsoever is laid upon him.

021:031 Whether he have gored a son, or have gored a daughter,
        according to this judgment shall it be done unto him.

021:032 If the ox shall push a manservant or a maidservant; he shall
        give unto their master thirty shekels of silver, and the ox
        shall be stoned.

021:033 And if a man shall open a pit, or if a man shall dig a pit,
        and not cover it, and an ox or an ass fall therein;

021:034 The owner of the pit shall make it good, and give money unto
        the owner of them; and the dead beast shall be his.

021:035 And if one man's ox hurt another's, that he die; then they
        shall sell the live ox, and divide the money of it; and the
        dead ox also they shall divide.

021:036 Or if it be known that the ox hath used to push in time past,
        and his owner hath not kept him in; he shall surely pay ox for
        ox; and the dead shall be his own.

022:001 If a man shall steal an ox, or a sheep, and kill it, or sell
        it; he shall restore five oxen for an ox, and four sheep for a
        sheep.

022:002 If a thief be found breaking up, and be smitten that he die,
        there shall no blood be shed for him.

022:003 If the sun be risen upon him, there shall be blood shed for
        him; for he should make full restitution; if he have nothing,
        then he shall be sold for his theft.

022:004 If the theft be certainly found in his hand alive, whether it
        be ox, or ass, or sheep; he shall restore double.

022:005 If a man shall cause a field or vineyard to be eaten, and
        shall put in his beast, and shall feed in another man's field;
        of the best of his own field, and of the best of his own
        vineyard, shall he make restitution.

022:006 If fire break out, and catch in thorns, so that the stacks of
        corn, or the standing corn, or the field, be consumed
        therewith; he that kindled the fire shall surely make
        restitution.

022:007 If a man shall deliver unto his neighbour money or stuff to
        keep, and it be stolen out of the man's house; if the thief be
        found, let him pay double.

022:008 If the thief be not found, then the master of the house shall
        be brought unto the judges, to see whether he have put his
        hand unto his neighbour's goods.

022:009 For all manner of trespass, whether it be for ox, for ass, for
        sheep, for raiment, or for any manner of lost thing which
        another challengeth to be his, the cause of both parties shall
        come before the judges; and whom the judges shall condemn, he
        shall pay double unto his neighbour.

022:010 If a man deliver unto his neighbour an ass, or an ox, or a
        sheep, or any beast, to keep; and it die, or be hurt, or
        driven away, no man seeing it:

022:011 Then shall an oath of the LORD be between them both, that he
        hath not put his hand unto his neighbour's goods; and the
        owner of it shall accept thereof, and he shall not make it
        good.

022:012 And if it be stolen from him, he shall make restitution unto
        the owner thereof.

022:013 If it be torn in pieces, then let him bring it for witness,
        and he shall not make good that which was torn.

022:014 And if a man borrow ought of his neighbour, and it be hurt, or
        die, the owner thereof being not with it, he shall surely make
        it good.

022:015 But if the owner thereof be with it, he shall not make it
        good: if it be an hired thing, it came for his hire.

022:016 And if a man entice a maid that is not betrothed, and lie with
        her, he shall surely endow her to be his wife.

022:017 If her father utterly refuse to give her unto him, he shall
        pay money according to the dowry of virgins.

022:018 Thou shalt not suffer a witch to live.

022:019 Whosoever lieth with a beast shall surely be put to death.

022:020 He that sacrificeth unto any god, save unto the LORD only, he
        shall be utterly destroyed.

022:021 Thou shalt neither vex a stranger, nor oppress him: for ye
        were strangers in the land of Egypt.

022:022 Ye shall not afflict any widow, or fatherless child.

022:023 If thou afflict them in any wise, and they cry at all unto me,
        I will surely hear their cry;

022:024 And my wrath shall wax hot, and I will kill you with the
        sword; and your wives shall be widows, and your children
        fatherless.

022:025 If thou lend money to any of my people that is poor by thee,
        thou shalt not be to him as an usurer, neither shalt thou lay
        upon him usury.

022:026 If thou at all take thy neighbour's raiment to pledge, thou
        shalt deliver it unto him by that the sun goeth down:

022:027 For that is his covering only, it is his raiment for his skin:
        wherein shall he sleep? and it shall come to pass, when he
        crieth unto me, that I will hear; for I am gracious.

022:028 Thou shalt not revile the gods, nor curse the ruler of thy
        people.

022:029 Thou shalt not delay to offer the first of thy ripe fruits,
        and of thy liquors: the firstborn of thy sons shalt thou give
        unto me.

022:030 Likewise shalt thou do with thine oxen, and with thy sheep:
        seven days it shall be with his dam; on the eighth day thou
        shalt give it me.

022:031 And ye shall be holy men unto me: neither shall ye eat any
        flesh that is torn of beasts in the field; ye shall cast it to
        the dogs.

023:001 Thou shalt not raise a false report: put not thine hand with
        the wicked to be an unrighteous witness.

023:002 Thou shalt not follow a multitude to do evil; neither shalt
        thou speak in a cause to decline after many to wrest judgment:

023:003 Neither shalt thou countenance a poor man in his cause.

023:004 If thou meet thine enemy's ox or his ass going astray, thou
        shalt surely bring it back to him again.

023:005 If thou see the ass of him that hateth thee lying under his
        burden, and wouldest forbear to help him, thou shalt surely
        help with him.

023:006 Thou shalt not wrest the judgment of thy poor in his cause.

023:007 Keep thee far from a false matter; and the innocent and
        righteous slay thou not: for I will not justify the wicked.

023:008 And thou shalt take no gift: for the gift blindeth the wise,
        and perverteth the words of the righteous.

023:009 Also thou shalt not oppress a stranger: for ye know the heart
        of a stranger, seeing ye were strangers in the land of Egypt.

023:010 And six years thou shalt sow thy land, and shalt gather in the
        fruits thereof:

023:011 But the seventh year thou shalt let it rest and lie still;
        that the poor of thy people may eat: and what they leave the
        beasts of the field shall eat. In like manner thou shalt deal
        with thy vineyard, and with thy oliveyard.

023:012 Six days thou shalt do thy work, and on the seventh day thou
        shalt rest: that thine ox and thine ass may rest, and the son
        of thy handmaid, and the stranger, may be refreshed.

023:013 And in all things that I have said unto you be circumspect:
        and make no mention of the name of other gods, neither let it
        be heard out of thy mouth.

023:014 Three times thou shalt keep a feast unto me in the year.

023:015 Thou shalt keep the feast of unleavened bread: (thou shalt eat
        unleavened bread seven days, as I commanded thee, in the time
        appointed of the month Abib; for in it thou camest out from
        Egypt: and none shall appear before me empty:)

023:016 And the feast of harvest, the firstfruits of thy labours,
        which thou hast sown in the field: and the feast of
        ingathering, which is in the end of the year, when thou hast
        gathered in thy labours out of the field.

023:017 Three items in the year all thy males shall appear before the
        LORD God.

023:018 Thou shalt not offer the blood of my sacrifice with leavened
        bread; neither shall the fat of my sacrifice remain until the
        morning.

023:019 The first of the firstfruits of thy land thou shalt bring into
        the house of the LORD thy God. Thou shalt not seethe a kid in
        his mother's milk.

023:020 Behold, I send an Angel before thee, to keep thee in the way,
        and to bring thee into the place which I have prepared.

023:021 Beware of him, and obey his voice, provoke him not; for he
        will not pardon your transgressions: for my name is in him.

023:022 But if thou shalt indeed obey his voice, and do all that I
        speak; then I will be an enemy unto thine enemies, and an
        adversary unto thine adversaries.

023:023 For mine Angel shall go before thee, and bring thee in unto
        the Amorites, and the Hittites, and the Perizzites, and the
        Canaanites, the Hivites, and the Jebusites: and I will cut
        them off.

023:024 Thou shalt not bow down to their gods, nor serve them, nor do
        after their works: but thou shalt utterly overthrow them, and
        quite break down their images.

023:025 And ye shall serve the LORD your God, and he shall bless thy
        bread, and thy water; and I will take sickness away from the
        midst of thee.

023:026 There shall nothing cast their young, nor be barren, in thy
        land: the number of thy days I will fulfil.

023:027 I will send my fear before thee, and will destroy all the
        people to whom thou shalt come, and I will make all thine
        enemies turn their backs unto thee.

023:028 And I will send hornets before thee, which shall drive out the
        Hivite, the Canaanite, and the Hittite, from before thee.

023:029 I will not drive them out from before thee in one year; lest
        the land become desolate, and the beast of the field multiply
        against thee.

023:030 By little and little I will drive them out from before thee,
        until thou be increased, and inherit the land.

023:031 And I will set thy bounds from the Red sea even unto the sea
        of the Philistines, and from the desert unto the river: for I
        will deliver the inhabitants of the land into your hand; and
        thou shalt drive them out before thee.

023:032 Thou shalt make no covenant with them, nor with their gods.

023:033 They shall not dwell in thy land, lest they make thee sin
        against me: for if thou serve their gods, it will surely be a
        snare unto thee.

024:001 And he said unto Moses, Come up unto the LORD, thou, and
        Aaron, Nadab, and Abihu, and seventy of the elders of Israel;
        and worship ye afar off.

024:002 And Moses alone shall come near the LORD: but they shall not
        come nigh; neither shall the people go up with him.

024:003 And Moses came and told the people all the words of the LORD,
        and all the judgments: and all the people answered with one
        voice, and said, All the words which the LORD hath said will
        we do.

024:004 And Moses wrote all the words of the LORD, and rose up early
        in the morning, and builded an altar under the hill, and
        twelve pillars, according to the twelve tribes of Israel.

024:005 And he sent young men of the children of Israel, which offered
        burnt offerings, and sacrificed peace offerings of oxen unto
        the LORD.

024:006 And Moses took half of the blood, and put it in basons; and
        half of the blood he sprinkled on the altar.

024:007 And he took the book of the covenant, and read in the audience
        of the people: and they said, All that the LORD hath said will
        we do, and be obedient.

024:008 And Moses took the blood, and sprinkled it on the people, and
        said, Behold the blood of the covenant, which the LORD hath
        made with you concerning all these words.

024:009 Then went up Moses, and Aaron, Nadab, and Abihu, and seventy
        of the elders of Israel:

024:010 And they saw the God of Israel: and there was under his feet
        as it were a paved work of a sapphire stone, and as it were
        the body of heaven in his clearness.

024:011 And upon the nobles of the children of Israel he laid not his
        hand: also they saw God, and did eat and drink.

024:012 And the LORD said unto Moses, Come up to me into the mount,
        and be there: and I will give thee tables of stone, and a law,
        and commandments which I have written; that thou mayest teach
        them.

024:013 And Moses rose up, and his minister Joshua: and Moses went up
        into the mount of God.

024:014 And he said unto the elders, Tarry ye here for us, until we
        come again unto you: and, behold, Aaron and Hur are with you:
        if any man have any matters to do, let him come unto them.

024:015 And Moses went up into the mount, and a cloud covered the
        mount.

024:016 And the glory of the LORD abode upon mount Sinai, and the
        cloud covered it six days: and the seventh day he called unto
        Moses out of the midst of the cloud.

024:017 And the sight of the glory of the LORD was like devouring fire
        on the top of the mount in the eyes of the children of Israel.

024:018 And Moses went into the midst of the cloud, and gat him up
        into the mount: and Moses was in the mount forty days and
        forty nights.

025:001 And the LORD spake unto Moses, saying,

025:002 Speak unto the children of Israel, that they bring me an
        offering: of every man that giveth it willingly with his heart
        ye shall take my offering.

025:003 And this is the offering which ye shall take of them; gold,
        and silver, and brass,

025:004 And blue, and purple, and scarlet, and fine linen, and goats'
        hair,

025:005 And rams' skins dyed red, and badgers' skins, and shittim
        wood,

025:006 Oil for the light, spices for anointing oil, and for sweet
        incense,

025:007 Onyx stones, and stones to be set in the ephod, and in the
        breastplate.

025:008 And let them make me a sanctuary; that I may dwell among them.

025:009 According to all that I shew thee, after the pattern of the
        tabernacle, and the pattern of all the instruments thereof,
        even so shall ye make it.

025:010 And they shall make an ark of shittim wood: two cubits and a
        half shall be the length thereof, and a cubit and a half the
        breadth thereof, and a cubit and a half the height thereof.

025:011 And thou shalt overlay it with pure gold, within and without
        shalt thou overlay it, and shalt make upon it a crown of gold
        round about.

025:012 And thou shalt cast four rings of gold for it, and put them in
        the four corners thereof; and two rings shall be in the one
        side of it, and two rings in the other side of it.

025:013 And thou shalt make staves of shittim wood, and overlay them
        with gold.

025:014 And thou shalt put the staves into the rings by the sides of
        the ark, that the ark may be borne with them.

025:015 The staves shall be in the rings of the ark: they shall not be
        taken from it.

025:016 And thou shalt put into the ark the testimony which I shall
        give thee.

025:017 And thou shalt make a mercy seat of pure gold: two cubits and
        a half shall be the length thereof, and a cubit and a half the
        breadth thereof.

025:018 And thou shalt make two cherubims of gold, of beaten work
        shalt thou make them, in the two ends of the mercy seat.

025:019 And make one cherub on the one end, and the other cherub on
        the other end: even of the mercy seat shall ye make the
        cherubims on the two ends thereof.

025:020 And the cherubims shall stretch forth their wings on high,
        covering the mercy seat with their wings, and their faces
        shall look one to another; toward the mercy seat shall the
        faces of the cherubims be.

025:021 And thou shalt put the mercy seat above upon the ark; and in
        the ark thou shalt put the testimony that I shall give thee.

025:022 And there I will meet with thee, and I will commune with thee
        from above the mercy seat, from between the two cherubims
        which are upon the ark of the testimony, of all things which I
        will give thee in commandment unto the children of Israel.

025:023 Thou shalt also make a table of shittim wood: two cubits shall
        be the length thereof, and a cubit the breadth thereof, and a
        cubit and a half the height thereof.

025:024 And thou shalt overlay it with pure gold, and make thereto a
        crown of gold round about.

025:025 And thou shalt make unto it a border of an hand breadth round
        about, and thou shalt make a golden crown to the border
        thereof round about.

025:026 And thou shalt make for it four rings of gold, and put the
        rings in the four corners that are on the four feet thereof.

025:027 Over against the border shall the rings be for places of the
        staves to bear the table.

025:028 And thou shalt make the staves of shittim wood, and overlay
        them with gold, that the table may be borne with them.

025:029 And thou shalt make the dishes thereof, and spoons thereof,
        and covers thereof, and bowls thereof, to cover withal: of
        pure gold shalt thou make them.

025:030 And thou shalt set upon the table shewbread before me alway.

025:031 And thou shalt make a candlestick of pure gold: of beaten work
        shall the candlestick be made: his shaft, and his branches,
        his bowls, his knops, and his flowers, shall be of the same.

025:032 And six branches shall come out of the sides of it; three
        branches of the candlestick out of the one side, and three
        branches of the candlestick out of the other side:

025:033 Three bowls made like unto almonds, with a knop and a flower
        in one branch; and three bowls made like almonds in the other
        branch, with a knop and a flower: so in the six branches that
        come out of the candlestick.

025:034 And in the candlesticks shall be four bowls made like unto
        almonds, with their knops and their flowers.

025:035 And there shall be a knop under two branches of the same, and
        a knop under two branches of the same, and a knop under two
        branches of the same, according to the six branches that
        proceed out of the candlestick.

025:036 Their knops and their branches shall be of the same: all it
        shall be one beaten work of pure gold.

025:037 And thou shalt make the seven lamps thereof: and they shall
        light the lamps thereof, that they may give light over against
        it.

025:038 And the tongs thereof, and the snuffdishes thereof, shall be
        of pure gold.

025:039 Of a talent of pure gold shall he make it, with all these
        vessels.

025:040 And look that thou make them after their pattern, which was
        shewed thee in the mount.

026:001 Moreover thou shalt make the tabernacle with ten curtains of
        fine twined linen, and blue, and purple, and scarlet: with
        cherubims of cunning work shalt thou make them.

026:002 The length of one curtain shall be eight and twenty cubits,
        and the breadth of one curtain four cubits: and every one of
        the curtains shall have one measure.

026:003 The five curtains shall be coupled together one to another;
        and other five curtains shall be coupled one to another.

026:004 And thou shalt make loops of blue upon the edge of the one
        curtain from the selvedge in the coupling; and likewise shalt
        thou make in the uttermost edge of another curtain, in the
        coupling of the second.

026:005 Fifty loops shalt thou make in the one curtain, and fifty
        loops shalt thou make in the edge of the curtain that is in
        the coupling of the second; that the loops may take hold one
        of another.

026:006 And thou shalt make fifty taches of gold, and couple the
        curtains together with the taches: and it shall be one
        tabernacle.

026:007 And thou shalt make curtains of goats' hair to be a covering
        upon the tabernacle: eleven curtains shalt thou make.

026:008 The length of one curtain shall be thirty cubits, and the
        breadth of one curtain four cubits: and the eleven curtains
        shall be all of one measure.

026:009 And thou shalt couple five curtains by themselves, and six
        curtains by themselves, and shalt double the sixth curtain in
        the forefront of the tabernacle.

026:010 And thou shalt make fifty loops on the edge of the one curtain
        that is outmost in the coupling, and fifty loops in the edge
        of the curtain which coupleth the second.

026:011 And thou shalt make fifty taches of brass, and put the taches
        into the loops, and couple the tent together, that it may be
        one.

026:012 And the remnant that remaineth of the curtains of the tent,
        the half curtain that remaineth, shall hang over the backside
        of the tabernacle.

026:013 And a cubit on the one side, and a cubit on the other side of
        that which remaineth in the length of the curtains of the
        tent, it shall hang over the sides of the tabernacle on this
        side and on that side, to cover it.

026:014 And thou shalt make a covering for the tent of rams' skins
        dyed red, and a covering above of badgers' skins.

026:015 And thou shalt make boards for the tabernacle of shittim wood
        standing up.

026:016 Ten cubits shall be the length of a board, and a cubit and a
        half shall be the breadth of one board.

026:017 Two tenons shall there be in one board, set in order one
        against another: thus shalt thou make for all the boards of
        the tabernacle.

026:018 And thou shalt make the boards for the tabernacle, twenty
        boards on the south side southward.

026:019 And thou shalt make forty sockets of silver under the twenty
        boards; two sockets under one board for his two tenons, and
        two sockets under another board for his two tenons.

026:020 And for the second side of the tabernacle on the north side
        there shall be twenty boards:

026:021 And their forty sockets of silver; two sockets under one
        board, and two sockets under another board.

026:022 And for the sides of the tabernacle westward thou shalt make
        six boards.

026:023 And two boards shalt thou make for the corners of the
        tabernacle in the two sides.

026:024 And they shall be coupled together beneath, and they shall be
        coupled together above the head of it unto one ring: thus
        shall it be for them both; they shall be for the two corners.

026:025 And they shall be eight boards, and their sockets of silver,
        sixteen sockets; two sockets under one board, and two sockets
        under another board.

        of the one side of the tabernacle,

026:027 And five bars for the boards of the other side of the
        tabernacle, and five bars for the boards of the side of the
        tabernacle, for the two sides westward.

026:028 And the middle bar in the midst of the boards shall reach from
        end to end.

026:029 And thou shalt overlay the boards with gold, and make their
        rings of gold for places for the bars: and thou shalt overlay
        the bars with gold.

026:030 And thou shalt rear up the tabernacle according to the fashion
        thereof which was shewed thee in the mount.

026:031 And thou shalt make a vail of blue, and purple, and scarlet,
        and fine twined linen of cunning work: with cherubims shall it
        be made:

026:032 And thou shalt hang it upon four pillars of shittim wood
        overlaid with gold: their hooks shall be of gold, upon the
        four sockets of silver.

026:033 And thou shalt hang up the vail under the taches, that thou
        mayest bring in thither within the vail the ark of the
        testimony: and the vail shall divide unto you between the holy
        place and the most holy.

026:034 And thou shalt put the mercy seat upon the ark of the
        testimony in the most holy place.

026:035 And thou shalt set the table without the vail, and the
        candlestick over against the table on the side of the
        tabernacle toward the south: and thou shalt put the table on
        the north side.

026:036 And thou shalt make an hanging for the door of the tent, of
        blue, and purple, and scarlet, and fine twined linen, wrought
        with needlework.

026:037 And thou shalt make for the hanging five pillars of shittim
        wood, and overlay them with gold, and their hooks shall be of
        gold: and thou shalt cast five sockets of brass for them.

027:001 And thou shalt make an altar of shittim wood, five cubits
        long, and five cubits broad; the altar shall be foursquare:
        and the height thereof shall be three cubits.

027:002 And thou shalt make the horns of it upon the four corners
        thereof: his horns shall be of the same: and thou shalt
        overlay it with brass.

027:003 And thou shalt make his pans to receive his ashes, and his
        shovels, and his basons, and his fleshhooks, and his firepans:
        all the vessels thereof thou shalt make of brass.

027:004 And thou shalt make for it a grate of network of brass; and
        upon the net shalt thou make four brasen rings in the four
        corners thereof.

027:005 And thou shalt put it under the compass of the altar beneath,
        that the net may be even to the midst of the altar.

027:006 And thou shalt make staves for the altar, staves of shittim
        wood, and overlay them with brass.

027:007 And the staves shall be put into the rings, and the staves
        shall be upon the two sides of the altar, to bear it.

027:008 Hollow with boards shalt thou make it: as it was shewed thee
        in the mount, so shall they make it.

027:009 And thou shalt make the court of the tabernacle: for the south
        side southward there shall be hangings for the court of fine
        twined linen of an hundred cubits long for one side:

027:010 And the twenty pillars thereof and their twenty sockets shall

        twined linen, and their sockets of brass.

027:019 All the vessels of the tabernacle in all the service thereof,
        and all the pins thereof, and all the pins of the court, shall
        be of brass.

027:020 And thou shalt command the children of Israel, that they bring
        thee pure oil olive beaten for the light, to cause the lamp to
        burn always.

027:021 In the tabernacle of the congregation without the vail, which
        is before the testimony, Aaron and his sons shall order it
        from evening to morning before the LORD: it shall be a statute
        for ever unto their generations on the behalf of the children
        of Israel.

028:001 And take thou unto thee Aaron thy brother, and his sons with
        him, from among the children of Israel, that he may minister
        unto me in the priest's office, even Aaron, Nadab and Abihu,
        Eleazar and Ithamar, Aaron's sons.

028:002 And thou shalt make holy garments for Aaron thy brother for
        glory and for beauty.

028:003 And thou shalt speak unto all that are wise hearted, whom I
        have filled with the spirit of wisdom, that they may make
        Aaron's garments to consecrate him, that he may minister unto
        me in the priest's office.

028:004 And these are the garments which they shall make; a
        breastplate, and an ephod, and a robe, and a broidered coat, a
        mitre, and a girdle: and they shall make holy garments for
        Aaron thy brother, and his sons, that he may minister unto me
        in the priest's office.

028:005 And they shall take gold, and blue, and purple, and scarlet,
        and fine linen.

028:006 And they shall make the ephod of gold, of blue, and of purple,
        of scarlet, and fine twined linen, with cunning work.

028:007 It shall have the two shoulderpieces thereof joined at the two
        edges thereof; and so it shall be joined together.

028:008 And the curious girdle of the ephod, which is upon it, shall
        be of the same, according to the work thereof; even of gold,
        of blue, and purple, and scarlet, and fine twined linen.

028:009 And thou shalt take two onyx stones, and grave on them the
        names of the children of Israel:

028:010 Six of their names on one stone, and the other six names of
        the rest on the other stone, according to their birth.

028:011 With the work of an engraver in stone, like the engravings of
        a signet, shalt thou engrave the two stones with the names of
        the children of Israel: thou shalt make them to be set in
        ouches of gold.

028:012 And thou shalt put the two stones upon the shoulders of the
        ephod for stones of memorial unto the children of Israel: and
        Aaron shall bear their names before the LORD upon his two
        shoulders for a memorial.

028:013 And thou shalt make ouches of gold;

028:014 And two chains of pure gold at the ends; of wreathen work
        shalt thou make them, and fasten the wreathen chains to the
        ouches.

028:015 And thou shalt make the breastplate of judgment with cunning
        work; after the work of the ephod thou shalt make it; of gold,
        of blue, and of purple, and of scarlet, and of fine twined
        linen, shalt thou make it.

028:016 Foursquare it shall be being doubled; a span shall be the
        length thereof, and a span shall be the breadth thereof.

028:017 And thou shalt set in it settings of stones, even four rows of
        stones: the first row shall be a sardius, a topaz, and a
        carbuncle: this shall be the first row.

028:018 And the second row shall be an emerald, a sapphire, and a
        diamond.

028:019 And the third row a ligure, an agate, and an amethyst.

028:020 And the fourth row a beryl, and an onyx, and a jasper: they
        shall be set in gold in their inclosings.

028:021 And the stones shall be with the names of the children of
        Israel, twelve, according to their names, like the engravings
        of a signet; every one with his name shall they be according
        to the twelve tribes.

028:022 And thou shalt make upon the breastplate chains at the ends of
        wreathen work of pure gold.

028:023 And thou shalt make upon the breastplate two rings of gold,
        and shalt put the two rings on the two ends of the
        breastplate.

028:024 And thou shalt put the two wreathen chains of gold in the two
        rings which are on the ends of the breastplate.

028:025 And the other two ends of the two wreathen chains thou shalt
        fasten in the two ouches, and put them on the shoulderpieces
        of the ephod before it.

028:026 And thou shalt make two rings of gold, and thou shalt put them
        upon the two ends of the breastplate in the border thereof,
        which is in the side of the ephod inward.

028:027 And two other rings of gold thou shalt make, and shalt put
        them on the two sides of the ephod underneath, toward the
        forepart thereof, over against the other coupling thereof,
        above the curious girdle of the ephod.

028:028 And they shall bind the breastplate by the rings thereof unto
        the rings of the ephod with a lace of blue, that it may be
        above the curious girdle of the ephod, and that the
        breastplate be not loosed from the ephod.

028:029 And Aaron shall bear the names of the children of Israel in
        the breastplate of judgment upon his heart, when he goeth in
        unto the holy place, for a memorial before the LORD
        continually.

028:030 And thou shalt put in the breastplate of judgment the Urim and
        the Thummim; and they shall be upon Aaron's heart, when he
        goeth in before the LORD: and Aaron shall bear the judgment of
        the children of Israel upon his heart before the LORD
        continually.

028:031 And thou shalt make the robe of the ephod all of blue.

028:032 And there shall be an hole in the top of it, in the midst
        thereof: it shall have a binding of woven work round about the
        hole of it, as it were the hole of an habergeon, that it be
        not rent.

028:033 And beneath upon the hem of it thou shalt make pomegranates of
        blue, and of purple, and of scarlet, round about the hem
        thereof; and bells of gold between them round about:

028:034 A golden bell and a pomegranate, a golden bell and a
        pomegranate, upon the hem of the robe round about.

028:035 And it shall be upon Aaron to minister: and his sound shall be
        heard when he goeth in unto the holy place before the LORD,
        and when he cometh out, that he die not.

028:036 And thou shalt make a plate of pure gold, and grave upon it,
        like the engravings of a signet, HOLINESS TO THE LORD.

028:037 And thou shalt put it on a blue lace, that it may be upon the
        mitre; upon the forefront of the mitre it shall be.

028:038 And it shall be upon Aaron's forehead, that Aaron may bear the
        iniquity of the holy things, which the children of Israel
        shall hallow in all their holy gifts; and it shall be always
        upon his forehead, that they may be accepted before the LORD.

028:039 And thou shalt embroider the coat of fine linen, and thou
        shalt make the mitre of fine linen, and thou shalt make the
        girdle of needlework.

028:040 And for Aaron's sons thou shalt make coats, and thou shalt
        make for them girdles, and bonnets shalt thou make for them,
        for glory and for beauty.

028:041 And thou shalt put them upon Aaron thy brother, and his sons
        with him; and shalt anoint them, and consecrate them, and
        sanctify them, that they may minister unto me in the priest's
        office.

028:042 And thou shalt make them linen breeches to cover their
        nakedness; from the loins even unto the thighs they shall
        reach:

028:043 And they shall be upon Aaron, and upon his sons, when they
        come in unto the tabernacle of the congregation, or when they
        come near unto the altar to minister in the holy place; that
        they bear not iniquity, and die: it shall be a statute for
        ever unto him and his seed after him.

029:001 And this is the thing that thou shalt do unto them to hallow
        them, to minister unto me in the priest's office: Take one
        young bullock, and two rams without blemish,

029:002 And unleavened bread, and cakes unleavened tempered with oil,
        and wafers unleavened anointed with oil: of wheaten flour
        shalt thou make them.

029:003 And thou shalt put them into one basket, and bring them in the
        basket, with the bullock and the two rams.

029:004 And Aaron and his sons thou shalt bring unto the door of the
        tabernacle of the congregation, and shalt wash them with
        water.

029:005 And thou shalt take the garments, and put upon Aaron the coat,
        and the robe of the ephod, and the ephod, and the breastplate,
        and gird him with the curious girdle of the ephod:

029:006 And thou shalt put the mitre upon his head, and put the holy
        crown upon the mitre.

029:007 Then shalt thou take the anointing oil, and pour it upon his
        head, and anoint him.

029:008 And thou shalt bring his sons, and put coats upon them.

029:009 And thou shalt gird them with girdles, Aaron and his sons, and
        put the bonnets on them: and the priest's office shall be
        theirs for a perpetual statute: and thou shalt consecrate
        Aaron and his sons.

029:010 And thou shalt cause a bullock to be brought before the
        tabernacle of the congregation: and Aaron and his sons shall
        put their hands upon the head of the bullock.

029:011 And thou shalt kill the bullock before the LORD, by the door
        of the tabernacle of the congregation.

029:012 And thou shalt take of the blood of the bullock, and put it
        upon the horns of the altar with thy finger, and pour all the
        blood beside the bottom of the altar.

029:013 And thou shalt take all the fat that covereth the inwards, and
        the caul that is above the liver, and the two kidneys, and the
        fat that is upon them, and burn them upon the altar.

029:014 But the flesh of the bullock, and his skin, and his dung,
        shalt thou burn with fire without the camp: it is a sin
        offering.

029:015 Thou shalt also take one ram; and Aaron and his sons shall put
        their hands upon the head of the ram.

029:016 And thou shalt slay the ram, and thou shalt take his blood,
        and sprinkle it round about upon the altar.

029:017 And thou shalt cut the ram in pieces, and wash the inwards of
        him, and his legs, and put them unto his pieces, and unto his
        head.

029:018 And thou shalt burn the whole ram upon the altar: it is a
        burnt offering unto the LORD: it is a sweet savour, an
        offering made by fire unto the LORD.

029:019 And thou shalt take the other ram; and Aaron and his sons
        shall put their hands upon the head of the ram.

029:020 Then shalt thou kill the ram, and take of his blood, and put
        it upon the tip of the right ear of Aaron, and upon the tip of
        the right ear of his sons, and upon the thumb of their right
        hand, and upon the great toe of their right foot, and sprinkle
        the blood upon the altar round about.

029:021 And thou shalt take of the blood that is upon the altar, and
        of the anointing oil, and sprinkle it upon Aaron, and upon his
        garments, and upon his sons, and upon the garments of his sons
        with him: and he shall be hallowed, and his garments, and his
        sons, and his sons' garments with him.

029:022 Also thou shalt take of the ram the fat and the rump, and the
        fat that covereth the inwards, and the caul above the liver,
        and the two kidneys, and the fat that is upon them, and the
        right shoulder; for it is a ram of consecration:

029:023 And one loaf of bread, and one cake of oiled bread, and one
        wafer out of the basket of the unleavened bread that is before
        the LORD:

029:024 And thou shalt put all in the hands of Aaron, and in the hands
        of his sons; and shalt wave them for a wave offering before
        the LORD.

029:025 And thou shalt receive them of their hands, and burn them upon
        the altar for a burnt offering, for a sweet savour before the
        LORD: it is an offering made by fire unto the LORD.

029:026 And thou shalt take the breast of the ram of Aaron's
        consecration, and wave it for a wave offering before the LORD:
        and it shall be thy part.

029:027 And thou shalt sanctify the breast of the wave offering, and
        the shoulder of the heave offering, which is waved, and which
        is heaved up, of the ram of the consecration, even of that
        which is for Aaron, and of that which is for his sons:

029:028 And it shall be Aaron's and his sons' by a statute for ever
        from the children of Israel: for it is an heave offering: and
        it shall be an heave offering from the children of Israel of
        the sacrifice of their peace offerings, even their heave
        offering unto the LORD.

029:029 And the holy garments of Aaron shall be his sons' after him,
        to be anointed therein, and to be consecrated in them.

029:030 And that son that is priest in his stead shall put them on
        seven days, when he cometh into the tabernacle of the
        congregation to minister in the holy place.

029:031 And thou shalt take the ram of the consecration, and seethe
        his flesh in the holy place.

029:032 And Aaron and his sons shall eat the flesh of the ram, and the
        bread that is in the basket by the door of the tabernacle of
        the congregation.

029:033 And they shall eat those things wherewith the atonement was
        made, to consecrate and to sanctify them: but a stranger shall
        not eat thereof, because they are holy.

029:034 And if ought of the flesh of the consecrations, or of the
        bread, remain unto the morning, then thou shalt burn the
        remainder with fire: it shall not be eaten, because it is
        holy.

029:035 And thus shalt thou do unto Aaron, and to his sons, according
        to all things which I have commanded thee: seven days shalt
        thou consecrate them.

029:036 And thou shalt offer every day a bullock for a sin offering
        for atonement: and thou shalt cleanse the altar, when thou
        hast made an atonement for it, and thou shalt anoint it, to
        sanctify it.

029:037 Seven days thou shalt make an atonement for the altar, and
        sanctify it; and it shall be an altar most holy: whatsoever
        toucheth the altar shall be holy.

029:038 Now this is that which thou shalt offer upon the altar; two
        lambs of the first year day by day continually.

029:039 The one lamb thou shalt offer in the morning; and the other
        lamb thou shalt offer at even:

029:040 And with the one lamb a tenth deal of flour mingled with the
        fourth part of an hin of beaten oil; and the fourth part of an
        hin of wine for a drink offering.

029:041 And the other lamb thou shalt offer at even, and shalt do
        thereto according to the meat offering of the morning, and
        according to the drink offering thereof, for a sweet savour,
        an offering made by fire unto the LORD.

029:042 This shall be a continual burnt offering throughout your
        generations at the door of the tabernacle of the congregation
        before the LORD: where I will meet you, to speak there unto
        thee.

029:043 And there I will meet with the children of Israel, and the
        tabernacle shall be sanctified by my glory.

029:044 And I will sanctify the tabernacle of the congregation, and
        the altar: I will sanctify also both Aaron and his sons, to
        minister to me in the priest's office.

029:045 And I will dwell among the children of Israel, and will be
        their God.

029:046 And they shall know that I am the LORD their God, that brought
        them forth out of the land of Egypt, that I may dwell among
        them: I am the LORD their God.

030:001 And thou shalt make an altar to burn incense upon: of shittim
        wood shalt thou make it.

030:002 A cubit shall be the length thereof, and a cubit the breadth
        thereof; foursquare shall it be: and two cubits shall be the
        height thereof: the horns thereof shall be of the same.

030:003 And thou shalt overlay it with pure gold, the top thereof, and
        the sides thereof round about, and the horns thereof; and thou
        shalt make unto it a crown of gold round about.

030:004 And two golden rings shalt thou make to it under the crown of
        it, by the two corners thereof, upon the two sides of it shalt
        thou make it; and they shall be for places for the staves to
        bear it withal.

030:005 And thou shalt make the staves of shittim wood, and overlay
        them with gold.

030:006 And thou shalt put it before the vail that is by the ark of
        the testimony, before the mercy seat that is over the
        testimony, where I will meet with thee.

030:007 And Aaron shall burn thereon sweet incense every morning: when
        he dresseth the lamps, he shall burn incense upon it.

030:008 And when Aaron lighteth the lamps at even, he shall burn
        incense upon it, a perpetual incense before the LORD
        throughout your generations.

030:009 Ye shall offer no strange incense thereon, nor burnt
        sacrifice, nor meat offering; neither shall ye pour drink
        offering thereon.

030:010 And Aaron shall make an atonement upon the horns of it once in
        a year with the blood of the sin offering of atonements: once
        in the year shall he make atonement upon it throughout your
        generations: it is most holy unto the LORD.

030:011 And the LORD spake unto Moses, saying,

030:012 When thou takest the sum of the children of Israel after their
        number, then shall they give every man a ransom for his soul
        unto the LORD, when thou numberest them; that there be no
        plague among them, when thou numberest them.

030:013 This they shall give, every one that passeth among them that
        are numbered, half a shekel after the shekel of the sanctuary:
        (a shekel is twenty gerahs:) an half shekel shall be the
        offering of the LORD.

030:014 Every one that passeth among them that are numbered, from
        twenty years old and above, shall give an offering unto the
        LORD.

030:015 The rich shall not give more, and the poor shall not give less
        than half a shekel, when they give an offering unto the LORD,
        to make an atonement for your souls.

030:016 And thou shalt take the atonement money of the children of
        Israel, and shalt appoint it for the service of the tabernacle
        of the congregation; that it may be a memorial unto the
        children of Israel before the LORD, to make an atonement for
        your souls.

030:017 And the LORD spake unto Moses, saying,

030:018 Thou shalt also make a laver of brass, and his foot also of
        brass, to wash withal: and thou shalt put it between the
        tabernacle of the congregation and the altar, and thou shalt
        put water therein.

030:019 For Aaron and his sons shall wash their hands and their feet
        thereat:

030:020 When they go into the tabernacle of the congregation, they
        shall wash with water, that they die not; or when they come
        near to the altar to minister, to burn offering made by fire
        unto the LORD:

030:021 So they shall wash their hands and their feet, that they die
        not: and it shall be a statute for ever to them, even to him
        and to his seed throughout their generations.

030:022 Moreover the LORD spake unto Moses, saying,

030:023 Take thou also unto thee principal spices, of pure myrrh five
        hundred shekels, and of sweet cinnamon half so much, even two
        hundred and fifty shekels, and of sweet calamus two hundred
        and fifty shekels,

030:024 And of cassia five hundred shekels, after the shekel of the
        sanctuary, and of oil olive an hin:

030:025 And thou shalt make it an oil of holy ointment, an ointment
        compound after the art of the apothecary: it shall be an holy
        anointing oil.

030:026 And thou shalt anoint the tabernacle of the congregation
        therewith, and the ark of the testimony,

030:027 And the table and all his vessels, and the candlestick and his
        vessels, and the altar of incense,

030:028 And the altar of burnt offering with all his vessels, and the
        laver and his foot.

030:029 And thou shalt sanctify them, that they may be most holy:
        whatsoever toucheth them shall be holy.

030:030 And thou shalt anoint Aaron and his sons, and consecrate them,
        that they may minister unto me in the priest's office.

030:031 And thou shalt speak unto the children of Israel, saying, This
        shall be an holy anointing oil unto me throughout your
        generations.

030:032 Upon man's flesh shall it not be poured, neither shall ye make
        any other like it, after the composition of it: it is holy,
        and it shall be holy unto you.

030:033 Whosoever compoundeth any like it, or whosoever putteth any of
        it upon a stranger, shall even be cut off from his people.

030:034 And the LORD said unto Moses, Take unto thee sweet spices,
        stacte, and onycha, and galbanum; these sweet spices with pure
        frankincense: of each shall there be a like weight:

030:035 And thou shalt make it a perfume, a confection after the art
        of the apothecary, tempered together, pure and holy:

030:036 And thou shalt beat some of it very small, and put of it
        before the testimony in the tabernacle of the congregation,
        where I will meet with thee: it shall be unto you most holy.

030:037 And as for the perfume which thou shalt make, ye shall not
        make to yourselves according to the composition thereof: it
        shall be unto thee holy for the LORD.

030:038 Whosoever shall make like unto that, to smell thereto, shall
        even be cut off from his people.

031:001 And the LORD spake unto Moses, saying,

031:002 See, I have called by name Bezaleel the son of Uri, the son of
        Hur, of the tribe of Judah:

031:003 And I have filled him with the spirit of God, in wisdom, and
        in understanding, and in knowledge, and in all manner of
        workmanship,

031:004 To devise cunning works, to work in gold, and in silver, and
        in brass,

031:005 And in cutting of stones, to set them, and in carving of
        timber, to work in all manner of workmanship.

031:006 And I, behold, I have given with him Aholiab, the son of
        Ahisamach, of the tribe of Dan: and in the hearts of all that
        are wise hearted I have put wisdom, that they may make all
        that I have commanded thee;

031:007 The tabernacle of the congregation, and the ark of the
        testimony, and the mercy seat that is thereupon, and all the
        furniture of the tabernacle,

031:008 And the table and his furniture, and the pure candlestick with
        all his furniture, and the altar of incense,

031:009 And the altar of burnt offering with all his furniture, and
        the laver and his foot,

031:010 And the cloths of service, and the holy garments for Aaron the
        priest, and the garments of his sons, to minister in the
        priest's office,

031:011 And the anointing oil, and sweet incense for the holy place:
        according to all that I have commanded thee shall they do.

031:012 And the LORD spake unto Moses, saying,

031:013 Speak thou also unto the children of Israel, saying, Verily my
        sabbaths ye shall keep: for it is a sign between me and you
        throughout your generations; that ye may know that I am the
        LORD that doth sanctify you.

031:014 Ye shall keep the sabbath therefore; for it is holy unto you:
        every one that defileth it shall surely be put to death: for
        whosoever doeth any work therein, that soul shall be cut off
        from among his people.

031:015 Six days may work be done; but in the seventh is the sabbath
        of rest, holy to the LORD: whosoever doeth any work in the
        sabbath day, he shall surely be put to death.

031:016 Wherefore the children of Israel shall keep the sabbath, to
        observe the sabbath throughout their generations, for a
        perpetual covenant.

031:017 It is a sign between me and the children of Israel for ever:
        for in six days the LORD made heaven and earth, and on the
        seventh day he rested, and was refreshed.

031:018 And he gave unto Moses, when he had made an end of communing
        with him upon mount Sinai, two tables of testimony, tables of
        stone, written with the finger of God.

032:001 And when the people saw that Moses delayed to come down out of
        the mount, the people gathered themselves together unto Aaron,
        and said unto him, Up, make us gods, which shall go before us;
        for as for this Moses, the man that brought us up out of the
        land of Egypt, we wot not what is become of him.

032:002 And Aaron said unto them, Break off the golden earrings, which
        are in the ears of your wives, of your sons, and of your
        daughters, and bring them unto me.

032:003 And all the people brake off the golden earrings which were in
        their ears, and brought them unto Aaron.

032:004 And he received them at their hand, and fashioned it with a
        graving tool, after he had made it a molten calf: and they
        said, These be thy gods, O Israel, which brought thee up out
        of the land of Egypt.

032:005 And when Aaron saw it, he built an altar before it; and Aaron
        made proclamation, and said, To morrow is a feast to the LORD.

032:006 And they rose up early on the morrow, and offered burnt
        offerings, and brought peace offerings; and the people sat
        down to eat and to drink, and rose up to play.

032:007 And the LORD said unto Moses, Go, get thee down; for thy
        people, which thou broughtest out of the land of Egypt, have
        corrupted themselves:

032:008 They have turned aside quickly out of the way which I
        commanded them: they have made them a molten calf, and have
        worshipped it, and have sacrificed thereunto, and said, These
        be thy gods, O Israel, which have brought thee up out of the
        land of Egypt.

032:009 And the LORD said unto Moses, I have seen this people, and,
        behold, it is a stiffnecked people:

032:010 Now therefore let me alone, that my wrath may wax hot against
        them, and that I may consume them: and I will make of thee a
        great nation.

032:011 And Moses besought the LORD his God, and said, LORD, why doth
        thy wrath wax hot against thy people, which thou hast brought
        forth out of the land of Egypt with great power, and with a
        mighty hand?

032:012 Wherefore should the Egyptians speak, and say, For mischief
        did he bring them out, to slay them in the mountains, and to
        consume them from the face of the earth? Turn from thy fierce
        wrath, and repent of this evil against thy people.

032:013 Remember Abraham, Isaac, and Israel, thy servants, to whom
        thou swarest by thine own self, and saidst unto them, I will
        multiply your seed as the stars of heaven, and all this land
        that I have spoken of will I give unto your seed, and they
        shall inherit it for ever.

032:014 And the LORD repented of the evil which he thought to do unto
        his people.

032:015 And Moses turned, and went down from the mount, and the two
        tables of the testimony were in his hand: the tables were
        written on both their sides; on the one side and on the other
        were they written.

032:016 And the tables were the work of God, and the writing was the
        writing of God, graven upon the tables.

032:017 And when Joshua heard the noise of the people as they shouted,
        he said unto Moses, There is a noise of war in the camp.

032:018 And he said, It is not the voice of them that shout for
        mastery, neither is it the voice of them that cry for being
        overcome: but the noise of them that sing do I hear.

032:019 And it came to pass, as soon as he came nigh unto the camp,
        that he saw the calf, and the dancing: and Moses' anger waxed
        hot, and he cast the tables out of his hands, and brake them
        beneath the mount.

032:020 And he took the calf which they had made, and burnt it in the
        fire, and ground it to powder, and strawed it upon the water,
        and made the children of Israel drink of it.

032:021 And Moses said unto Aaron, What did this people unto thee,
        that thou hast brought so great a sin upon them?

032:022 And Aaron said, Let not the anger of my lord wax hot: thou
        knowest the people, that they are set on mischief.

032:023 For they said unto me, Make us gods, which shall go before us:
        for as for this Moses, the man that brought us up out of the
        land of Egypt, we wot not what is become of him.

032:024 And I said unto them, Whosoever hath any gold, let them break
        it off. So they gave it me: then I cast it into the fire, and
        there came out this calf.

032:025 And when Moses saw that the people were naked; (for Aaron had
        made them naked unto their shame among their enemies:)

032:026 Then Moses stood in the gate of the camp, and said, Who is on
        the LORD's side? let him come unto me. And all the sons of
        Levi gathered themselves together unto him.

032:027 And he said unto them, Thus saith the LORD God of Israel, Put
        every man his sword by his side, and go in and out from gate
        to gate throughout the camp, and slay every man his brother,
        and every man his companion, and every man his neighbour.

032:028 And the children of Levi did according to the word of Moses:
        and there fell of the people that day about three thousand
        men.

032:029 For Moses had said, Consecrate yourselves today to the LORD,
        even every man upon his son, and upon his brother; that he may
        bestow upon you a blessing this day.

032:030 And it came to pass on the morrow, that Moses said unto the
        people, Ye have sinned a great sin: and now I will go up unto
        the LORD; peradventure I shall make an atonement for your sin.

032:031 And Moses returned unto the LORD, and said, Oh, this people
        have sinned a great sin, and have made them gods of gold.

032:032 Yet now, if thou wilt forgive their sin--; and if not, blot
        me, I pray thee, out of thy book which thou hast written.

032:033 And the LORD said unto Moses, Whosoever hath sinned against
        me, him will I blot out of my book.

032:034 Therefore now go, lead the people unto the place of which I
        have spoken unto thee: behold, mine Angel shall go before
        thee: nevertheless in the day when I visit I will visit their
        sin upon them.

032:035 And the LORD plagued the people, because they made the calf,
        which Aaron made.

033:001 And the LORD said unto Moses, Depart, and go up hence, thou
        and the people which thou hast brought up out of the land of
        Egypt, unto the land which I sware unto Abraham, to Isaac, and
        to Jacob, saying, Unto thy seed will I give it:

033:002 And I will send an angel before thee; and I will drive out the
        Canaanite, the Amorite, and the Hittite, and the Perizzite,
        the Hivite, and the Jebusite:

033:003 Unto a land flowing with milk and honey: for I will not go up
        in the midst of thee; for thou art a stiffnecked people: lest
        I consume thee in the way.

033:004 And when the people heard these evil tidings, they mourned:
        and no man did put on him his ornaments.

033:005 For the LORD had said unto Moses, Say unto the children of
        Israel, Ye are a stiffnecked people: I will come up into the
        midst of thee in a moment, and consume thee: therefore now put
        off thy ornaments from thee, that I may know what to do unto
        thee.

033:006 And the children of Israel stripped themselves of their
        ornaments by the mount Horeb.

033:007 And Moses took the tabernacle, and pitched it without the
        camp, afar off from the camp, and called it the Tabernacle of
        the congregation. And it came to pass, that every one which
        sought the LORD went out unto the tabernacle of the
        congregation, which was without the camp.

033:008 And it came to pass, when Moses went out unto the tabernacle,
        that all the people rose up, and stood every man at his tent
        door, and looked after Moses, until he was gone into the
        tabernacle.

033:009 And it came to pass, as Moses entered into the tabernacle, the
        cloudy pillar descended, and stood at the door of the
        tabernacle, and the Lord talked with Moses.

033:010 And all the people saw the cloudy pillar stand at the
        tabernacle door: and all the people rose up and worshipped,
        every man in his tent door.

033:011 And the LORD spake unto Moses face to face, as a man speaketh
        unto his friend. And he turned again into the camp: but his
        servant Joshua, the son of Nun, a young man, departed not out
        of the tabernacle.

033:012 And Moses said unto the LORD, See, thou sayest unto me, Bring
        up this people: and thou hast not let me know whom thou wilt
        send with me. Yet thou hast said, I know thee by name, and
        thou hast also found grace in my sight.

033:013 Now therefore, I pray thee, if I have found grace in thy
        sight, shew me now thy way, that I may know thee, that I may
        find grace in thy sight: and consider that this nation is thy
        people.

033:014 And he said, My presence shall go with thee, and I will give
        thee rest.

033:015 And he said unto him, If thy presence go not with me, carry us
        not up hence.

033:016 For wherein shall it be known here that I and thy people have
        found grace in thy sight? is it not in that thou goest with
        us? so shall we be separated, I and thy people, from all the
        people that are upon the face of the earth.

033:017 And the LORD said unto Moses, I will do this thing also that
        thou hast spoken: for thou hast found grace in my sight, and I
        know thee by name.

033:018 And he said, I beseech thee, shew me thy glory.

033:019 And he said, I will make all my goodness pass before thee, and
        I will proclaim the name of the LORD before thee; and will be
        gracious to whom I will be gracious, and will shew mercy on
        whom I will shew mercy.

033:020 And he said, Thou canst not see my face: for there shall no
        man see me, and live.

033:021 And the LORD said, Behold, there is a place by me, and thou
        shalt stand upon a rock:

033:022 And it shall come to pass, while my glory passeth by, that I
        will put thee in a clift of the rock, and will cover thee with
        my hand while I pass by:

033:023 And I will take away mine hand, and thou shalt see my back
        parts: but my face shall not be seen.

034:001 And the LORD said unto Moses, Hew thee two tables of stone
        like unto the first: and I will write upon these tables the
        words that were in the first tables, which thou brakest.

034:002 And be ready in the morning, and come up in the morning unto
        mount Sinai, and present thyself there to me in the top of the
        mount.

034:003 And no man shall come up with thee, neither let any man be
        seen throughout all the mount; neither let the flocks nor
        herds feed before that mount.

034:004 And he hewed two tables of stone like unto the first; and
        Moses rose up early in the morning, and went up unto mount
        Sinai, as the LORD had commanded him, and took in his hand the
        two tables of stone.

034:005 And the LORD descended in the cloud, and stood with him there,
        and proclaimed the name of the LORD.

034:006 And the LORD passed by before him, and proclaimed, The LORD,
        The LORD God, merciful and gracious, longsuffering, and
        abundant in goodness and truth,

034:007 Keeping mercy for thousands, forgiving iniquity and
        transgression and sin, and that will by no means clear the
        guilty; visiting the iniquity of the fathers upon the
        children, and upon the children's children, unto the third and
        to the fourth generation.

034:008 And Moses made haste, and bowed his head toward the earth, and
        worshipped.

034:009 And he said, If now I have found grace in thy sight, O LORD,
        let my LORD, I pray thee, go among us; for it is a stiffnecked
        people; and pardon our iniquity and our sin, and take us for
        thine inheritance.

034:010 And he said, Behold, I make a covenant: before all thy people
        I will do marvels, such as have not been done in all the
        earth, nor in any nation: and all the people among which thou
        art shall see the work of the LORD: for it is a terrible thing
        that I will do with thee.

034:011 Observe thou that which I command thee this day: behold, I
        drive out before thee the Amorite, and the Canaanite, and the
        Hittite, and the Perizzite, and the Hivite, and the Jebusite.

034:012 Take heed to thyself, lest thou make a covenant with the
        inhabitants of the land whither thou goest, lest it be for a
        snare in the midst of thee:

034:013 But ye shall destroy their altars, break their images, and cut
        down their groves:

034:014 For thou shalt worship no other god: for the LORD, whose name
        is Jealous, is a jealous God:

034:015 Lest thou make a covenant with the inhabitants of the land,
        and they go a whoring after their gods, and do sacrifice unto
        their gods, and one call thee, and thou eat of his sacrifice;

034:016 And thou take of their daughters unto thy sons, and their
        daughters go a whoring after their gods, and make thy sons go
        a whoring after their gods.

034:017 Thou shalt make thee no molten gods.

034:018 The feast of unleavened bread shalt thou keep. Seven days thou
        shalt eat unleavened bread, as I commanded thee, in the time
        of the month Abib: for in the month Abib thou camest out from
        Egypt.

034:019 All that openeth the matrix is mine; and every firstling among
        thy cattle, whether ox or sheep, that is male.

034:020 But the firstling of an ass thou shalt redeem with a lamb: and
        if thou redeem him not, then shalt thou break his neck. All
        the firstborn of thy sons thou shalt redeem. And none shall
        appear before me empty.

034:021 Six days thou shalt work, but on the seventh day thou shalt
        rest: in earing time and in harvest thou shalt rest.

034:022 And thou shalt observe the feast of weeks, of the firstfruits
        of wheat harvest, and the feast of ingathering at the year's
        end.

034:023 Thrice in the year shall all your menchildren appear before
        the LORD God, the God of Israel.

034:024 For I will cast out the nations before thee, and enlarge thy
        borders: neither shall any man desire thy land, when thou
        shalt go up to appear before the LORD thy God thrice in the
        year.

034:025 Thou shalt not offer the blood of my sacrifice with leaven;
        neither shall the sacrifice of the feast of the passover be
        left unto the morning.

034:026 The first of the firstfruits of thy land thou shalt bring unto
        the house of the LORD thy God. Thou shalt not seethe a kid in
        his mother's milk.

034:027 And the LORD said unto Moses, Write thou these words: for
        after the tenor of these words I have made a covenant with
        thee and with Israel.

034:028 And he was there with the LORD forty days and forty nights; he
        did neither eat bread, nor drink water. And he wrote upon the
        tables the words of the covenant, the ten commandments.

034:029 And it came to pass, when Moses came down from mount Sinai
        with the two tables of testimony in Moses' hand, when he came
        down from the mount, that Moses wist not that the skin of his
        face shone while he talked with him.

034:030 And when Aaron and all the children of Israel saw Moses,
        behold, the skin of his face shone; and they were afraid to
        come nigh him.

034:031 And Moses called unto them; and Aaron and all the rulers of
        the congregation returned unto him: and Moses talked with
        them.

034:032 And afterward all the children of Israel came nigh: and he
        gave them in commandment all that the LORD had spoken with him
        in mount Sinai.

034:033 And till Moses had done speaking with them, he put a vail on
        his face.

034:034 But when Moses went in before the LORD to speak with him, he
        took the vail off, until he came out. And he came out, and
        spake unto the children of Israel that which he was commanded.

034:035 And the children of Israel saw the face of Moses, that the
        skin of Moses' face shone: and Moses put the vail upon his
        face again, until he went in to speak with him.

035:001 And Moses gathered all the congregation of the children of
        Israel together, and said unto them, These are the words which
        the LORD hath commanded, that ye should do them.

035:002 Six days shall work be done, but on the seventh day there
        shall be to you an holy day, a sabbath of rest to the LORD:
        whosoever doeth work therein shall be put to death.

035:003 Ye shall kindle no fire throughout your habitations upon the
        sabbath day.

035:004 And Moses spake unto all the congregation of the children of
        Israel, saying, This is the thing which the LORD commanded,
        saying,

035:005 Take ye from among you an offering unto the LORD: whosoever is
        of a willing heart, let him bring it, an offering of the LORD;
        gold, and silver, and brass,

035:006 And blue, and purple, and scarlet, and fine linen, and goats'
        hair,

035:007 And rams' skins dyed red, and badgers' skins, and shittim
        wood,

035:008 And oil for the light, and spices for anointing oil, and for
        the sweet incense,

035:009 And onyx stones, and stones to be set for the ephod, and for
        the breastplate.

035:010 And every wise hearted among you shall come, and make all that
        the LORD hath commanded;

035:011 The tabernacle, his tent, and his covering, his taches, and
        his boards, his bars, his pillars, and his sockets,

035:012 The ark, and the staves thereof, with the mercy seat, and the
        vail of the covering,

035:013 The table, and his staves, and all his vessels, and the
        shewbread,

035:014 The candlestick also for the light, and his furniture, and his
        lamps, with the oil for the light,

035:015 And the incense altar, and his staves, and the anointing oil,
        and the sweet incense, and the hanging for the door at the
        entering in of the tabernacle,

035:016 The altar of burnt offering, with his brasen grate, his
        staves, and all his vessels, the laver and his foot,

035:017 The hangings of the court, his pillars, and their sockets, and
        the hanging for the door of the court,

035:018 The pins of the tabernacle, and the pins of the court, and
        their cords,

035:019 The cloths of service, to do service in the holy place, the
        holy garments for Aaron the priest, and the garments of his
        sons, to minister in the priest's office.

035:020 And all the congregation of the children of Israel departed
        from the presence of Moses.

035:021 And they came, every one whose heart stirred him up, and every
        one whom his spirit made willing, and they brought the LORD's
        offering to the work of the tabernacle of the congregation,
        and for all his service, and for the holy garments.

035:022 And they came, both men and women, as many as were willing
        hearted, and brought bracelets, and earrings, and rings, and
        tablets, all jewels of gold: and every man that offered
        offered an offering of gold unto the LORD.

035:023 And every man, with whom was found blue, and purple, and
        scarlet, and fine linen, and goats' hair, and red skins of
        rams, and badgers' skins, brought them.

035:024 Every one that did offer an offering of silver and brass
        brought the LORD's offering: and every man, with whom was
        found shittim wood for any work of the service, brought it.

035:025 And all the women that were wise hearted did spin with their
        hands, and brought that which they had spun, both of blue, and
        of purple, and of scarlet, and of fine linen.

035:026 And all the women whose heart stirred them up in wisdom spun
        goats' hair.

035:027 And the rulers brought onyx stones, and stones to be set, for
        the ephod, and for the breastplate;

035:028 And spice, and oil for the light, and for the anointing oil,
        and for the sweet incense.

035:029 The children of Israel brought a willing offering unto the
        LORD, every man and woman, whose heart made them willing to
        bring for all manner of work, which the LORD had commanded to
        be made by the hand of Moses.

035:030 And Moses said unto the children of Israel, See, the LORD hath
        called by name Bezaleel the son of Uri, the son of Hur, of the
        tribe of Judah;

035:031 And he hath filled him with the spirit of God, in wisdom, in
        understanding, and in knowledge, and in all manner of
        workmanship;

035:032 And to devise curious works, to work in gold, and in silver,
        and in brass,

035:033 And in the cutting of stones, to set them, and in carving of
        wood, to make any manner of cunning work.

035:034 And he hath put in his heart that he may teach, both he, and
        Aholiab, the son of Ahisamach, of the tribe of Dan.

035:035 Them hath he filled with wisdom of heart, to work all manner
        of work, of the engraver, and of the cunning workman, and of
        the embroiderer, in blue, and in purple, in scarlet, and in
        fine linen, and of the weaver, even of them that do any work,
        and of those that devise cunning work.

036:001 Then wrought Bezaleel and Aholiab, and every wise hearted man,
        in whom the LORD put wisdom and understanding to know how to
        work all manner of work for the service of the sanctuary,
        according to all that the LORD had commanded.

036:002 And Moses called Bezaleel and Aholiab, and every wise hearted
        man, in whose heart the LORD had put wisdom, even every one
        whose heart stirred him up to come unto the work to do it:

036:003 And they received of Moses all the offering, which the
        children of Israel had brought for the work of the service of
        the sanctuary, to make it withal. And they brought yet unto
        him free offerings every morning.

036:004 And all the wise men, that wrought all the work of the
        sanctuary, came every man from his work which they made;

036:005 And they spake unto Moses, saying, The people bring much more
        than enough for the service of the work, which the LORD
        commanded to make.

036:006 And Moses gave commandment, and they caused it to be
        proclaimed throughout the camp, saying, Let neither man nor
        woman make any more work for the offering of the sanctuary. So
        the people were restrained from bringing.

036:007 For the stuff they had was sufficient for all the work to make
        it, and too much.

036:008 And every wise hearted man among them that wrought the work of
        the tabernacle made ten curtains of fine twined linen, and
        blue, and purple, and scarlet: with cherubims of cunning work
        made he them.

036:009 The length of one curtain was twenty and eight cubits, and the
        breadth of one curtain four cubits: the curtains were all of
        one size.

036:010 And he coupled the five curtains one unto another: and the
        other five curtains he coupled one unto another.

036:011 And he made loops of blue on the edge of one curtain from the
        selvedge in the coupling: likewise he made in the uttermost
        side of another curtain, in the coupling of the second.

036:012 Fifty loops made he in one curtain, and fifty loops made he in
        the edge of the curtain which was in the coupling of the
        second: the loops held one curtain to another.

036:013 And he made fifty taches of gold, and coupled the curtains one
        unto another with the taches: so it became one tabernacle.

036:014 And he made curtains of goats' hair for the tent over the
        tabernacle: eleven curtains he made them.

036:015 The length of one curtain was thirty cubits, and four cubits
        was the breadth of one curtain: the eleven curtains were of
        one size.

036:016 And he coupled five curtains by themselves, and six curtains
        by themselves.

036:017 And he made fifty loops upon the uttermost edge of the curtain
        in the coupling, and fifty loops made he upon the edge of the
        curtain which coupleth the second.

036:018 And he made fifty taches of brass to couple the tent together,
        that it might be one.

036:019 And he made a covering for the tent of rams' skins dyed red,
        and a covering of badgers' skins above that.

036:020 And he made boards for the tabernacle of shittim wood,
        standing up.

036:021 The length of a board was ten cubits, and the breadth of a
        board one cubit and a half.

036:022 One board had two tenons, equally distant one from another:
        thus did he make for all the boards of the tabernacle.

036:023 And he made boards for the tabernacle; twenty boards for the
        south side southward:

036:024 And forty sockets of silver he made under the twenty boards;
        two sockets under one board for his two tenons, and two
        sockets under another board for his two tenons.

036:025 And for the other side of the tabernacle, which is toward the
        north corner, he made twenty boards,

036:026 And their forty sockets of silver; two sockets under one
        board, and two sockets under another board.

036:027 And for the sides of the tabernacle westward he made six
        boards.

036:028 And two boards made he for the corners of the tabernacle in
        the two sides.

036:029 And they were coupled beneath, and coupled together at the
        head thereof, to one ring: thus he did to both of them in both
        the corners.

036:030 And there were eight boards; and their sockets were sixteen
